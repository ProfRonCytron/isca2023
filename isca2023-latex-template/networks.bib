  ABSTRACT =	 "The technique of remote procedure calls is emerging
                  as a popular approach to communication in locally
                  distributed computations. The general idea of RPC --
                  to provide an efficient and robust mechanism
                  faithful to the semantics of ordinary procedure
                  calls in a given language -- has great appeal. The
                  advantages of actually using the RPC approach in a
                  particular language-system context, however, can
                  depend dramatically on the particular language and
                  system used. In this paper, we describe one such RPC
                  system, based upon Module-2 and the V operating
                  system. The paper focuses on how particular aspects
                  of our language and system context influenced the
                  nature and quality of the resulting system. The
                  lessons learned have implications both for others
                  contemplating RPC designs and for designers of
                  languages and operating system."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Many future distributed system applications will
                  require that the underlying system have Real-time
                  properties. For example, applications that use
                  continuous media (digital audio and video) typically
                  have bounds on end-to-end delay and throughput. To
                  reliably support such applications, the individual
                  components of the system (CPU, network, file system)
                  must provide Real-time properties. Furthermore,
                  these components must be coordinated so that
                  end-to-end-bounds are satisfied. This paper is
                  concerned with adding the Real-time properties
                  needed by continuous media to environments based on
                  the DoD Internet and the UNIX operating
                  system. First, we give a workload and scheduling
                  model for continuous media. We the describe the
                  Session Reservation Protocol (SRP), which performs
                  negotiated resource reservation based on cost
                  minimization. SRP is independent of transport
                  protocols; it can be used with standard protocols
                  such as TCP or with other protocols, and it does not
                  modify the format of IP data packets. Finally, we
                  discuss modifications to UNIX-type operating systems
                  to correctly schedule CPU and network resources
                  according to the model used by SRP."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Next-generation workstations will have hardware
                  support for digital continuous media (DCM) such as
                  audio and video. CM applications handle data at high
                  rates, with strict timing requirements, and often in
                  small chunks. If such applications are to run
                  efficiently and predictably as user-level programs,
                  an operating system must provide scheduling and IPC
                  mechanisms that reflect these needs. We propose two
                  such mechanisms: split-level CPU scheduling or
                  lightweight processes in multiple address spaces,
                  and memory-mapped streams for data movement between
                  address spaces. These techniques reduce the number
                  of user/kernel interactions (system calls, signals,
                  and preemptions). Compared to existing mechanisms,
                  they can reduce scheduling and I/O overhead by a
                  factor of 4 to 6."

                  elaborate addition to the underlying kernel and
                  utility-process base. It separates policy (when to
                  migrate which process to what destination) from
                  mechanism (how to detach, transfer, and reattach the
                  migrant process). While the mechanism is fixed in
                  the kernel and one of the utilities, the policy is
                  relegated to a utility and can be replaced
                  easily. The kernel provides elaborate state
                  information to that utility. The mechanism allows
                  concurrent multiple migrations and premature
                  cancellation of migration. It leaves no residual
                  dependency on the source machine for the migrant
                  process. The mechanism copes with all conceivable
                  crash and termination scenarios, rescuing the
                  migrant process in most cases."

  ABSTRACT =	 "This paper explores program designs for layered
                  systems such as communication protocols and
                  server/client systems that do not exhibit a strict
                  hierarchy in their control flow. Clark has proposed
                  structuring such systems, where both upward and
                  downward control flow are required, to use efficient
                  synchronous procedure calls between the layers
                  whenever possible. The term upcall is used by Clark
                  to describe the synchronous upward communication
                  from server to client. Several techniques are
                  possible for structuring such programs using
                  upcalls. Comparisons are made by implementing a
                  communication protocol described by Clark in three
                  different ways. The first method implements all the
                  protocol routines in a single large module. The
                  second method structures the routines into modules
                  occupying vertical slices of the protocol layers,
                  and the third method structures the routines into
                  modules corresponding to the protocol
                  layers. Comparisons are made on two fronts:
                  preservation of modularity, in order to determine
                  which method shows fault-tolerance and ease of
                  programming, and program performance, which is a key
                  motivation for the upcalls programming style. We
                  conclude that the vertically layered protocol design
                  is to be preferred unless there are many shared
                  variables between the send-side and receive-side, as
                  it is very efficient and provides the best
                  protection of clients from each other. The
                  horizontally layered design is the least efficient,
                  but it is the easiest to program."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Historically, long haul network transport level
                  protocols such as DARPA's TCP/IP have been
                  conveniently adopted for use on local area networks
                  also. This paper discusses and describes a new
                  connection-oriented transport level protocol (LNTP)
                  specifically designed for use on LANs. The
                  fundamental philosophy in the design of LNTP is
                  simplicity. Features irrelevant to the LAN
                  environment are not included, resulting in a simpler
                  and more efficient protocol. As well, LNTP uses a
                  simple but effective two-region flow control
                  mechanism which is activated only when the traffic
                  intensity exceeds some value. This eliminates
                  control packets during normal operation and
                  increases concurrency between sender and
                  receiver. LNTP runs under 4.2 BSD UNIX in place of
                  TCP/IP. Detailed comparisons between LNTP and TCP/IP
                  show that LNTP is several times faster than TCP/IP,
                  although end-to-end throughput rates are only 30
                  percent faster because of the overhead attributed to
                  Ethernet and UNIX layers. However, the reduced CPU
                  cycles as well as the increased network throughput
                  indicate that LNTP is a viable replacement for
                  TCP/IP."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Until recently, at least one thing was clear about
                  parallel programming: tightly coupled (shared
                  memory) machines were programmed in a language based
                  on shared variables and loosely coupled
                  (distributed) systems were programmed using message
                  passing. The explosive growth of research on
                  distributed system and their languages, however, has
                  led to several new methodologies that blur this
                  simple distinction. Operating system primitives
                  (e.g., problem-oriented shared memory, Shared
                  Virtual Memory, the Agora shared memory) and
                  languages (e.g., concurrent prolog, Linda, Emerald)
                  for programming distributed systems have been
                  proposed that support the shared variable paradigm
                  without the presence of physically shared memory. In
                  this paper we will look at the reasons for this
                  evolution, the resemblances and differences among
                  these proposals, and the key issues in their design
                  and implementation. It turns out that many
                  implementations are based on replication of data. We
                  take this idea one step further, and discuss how
                  automatic replication (initiated by the runtime
                  system) can be used as a basis for a new model,
                  called the shared memory data-object model, whose
                  semantics are similar to the shared variable
                  model. Finally, we discuss the design of a new
                  language for distributed programming, Orca, based on
                  the shared data-object model."

  ABSTRACT =	 "The shared data-object model is designed to ease the
                  implementation of parallel applications on loosely
                  coupled distributed systems. Unlike most other
                  models for distributed programming (e.g., RPC) the
                  shared data-object model allows processes on
                  different machines to share data. Such data are
                  encapsulated in data-objects, which are instances of
                  user-defined abstract data types. The shared
                  data-object model forms the basis of a new language
                  for distributed programming, Orca, which gives
                  linguistic support for parallelism and
                  data-objects. A distributed implementation of the
                  shared data-object model should take care of the
                  physical distribution of objects among the local
                  memories of the processors. In particular, an
                  implementation may replicate objects in order to
                  decrease access time to objects and increase
                  parallelism. The intent of this paper is to show
                  that, for several applications, the proposed model
                  is both easy to use and efficient. We first give a
                  brief description of the shared data-object model
                  and Orca. Next, we describe one of several existing
                  implementations of Orca. This implementation
                  replicates all objects on all processors and updates
                  replicas through a reliable broadcast protocol. We
                  describe all three layers of this implementation:
                  the Orca compiler, the Orca run time system, and the
                  reliable broadcast protocol. finally, we report on
                  our experiences in using this implementation. We
                  describe three parallel applications written in Orca
                  and give performance measurements for them. We also
                  compare these figures with those of a nondistributed
                  (shared-memory) implementation of Orca. The
                  measurements show that significant speedups can be
                  obtained for all three applications."

  ABSTRACT =	 "The UNIX operating system provides support for the
                  real time scheduling of events through a mechanism
                  known as the callout table. To meet the needs of
                  Real-time applications, the execution times of the
                  callout scheduling operations must be short with
                  small variance. Unfortunately, the callout table has
                  traditionally been implemented as a linearly ordered
                  array, and it performs poorly when heavily used. In
                  this paper, we describe the design, analysis, and
                  measurement of a callout table based on a heap data
                  structure. Measurements taken on a prototype build
                  with UNIX System V Release 2 suggest that a
                  heap-based callout table is much more efficient and
                  predictable than the standard array-based table, and
                  thus is better suited to meet the requirements of
                  Real-time applications. We also discuss a delayed
                  event heuristic that buffers events without
                  reheaping; this strategy can cut in half the cost of
                  some callout operations. The current implementation
                  of the callout table uses relative timing to
                  sequence events; in this paper we discuss using
                  absolute timing in the table to better capture the
                  essence of event ordering and allow implementations
                  that use new data structures. We also analyze a
                  linked list-based callout table and compare its
                  amortized computational complexity to that of the
                  heap-based table."

                  application-to-application transfer rate using a
                  ``standard'' programming interface. It uses data
                  links that operate up to 1 gigabits/sec and very
                  high speed bridges to connect them into a
                  multinigabit seamless fabric. UltraNet is different
                  from many local area networks in that it provides
                  more than just a data link. It also provides a set
                  of transport layer services, both
                  connection-oriented and connectionless, at a very
                  high transfer rate. This paper presents an overview

                  performance of various UltraNet configurations,
                  discusses the rationale behinds its design, and

  ABSTRACT =	 "Lightweight Remote Procedure Call (LRPC) is a
                  communication facility designed and optimized for
                  communication between protection domains on the same
                  machine. In contemporary small-kernel operating
                  systems, existing RPC systems incur an unnecessarily
                  high cost when used for the type of communication
                  that predominates -- between protection domains on
                  the same machine. This cost leads system designers
                  to coalesce weakly-related subsystems into the same
                  protection domain, trading safety for
                  performance. By reducing the overhead of
                  same-machine communication, LRPC encourages both
                  safety and performance. LRPC combines the control
                  transfer and communication model of capability
                  systems with the programming semantics and
                  large-grained protection model of RPC. LRPC achieves
                  a factor of three performance improvement over more
                  traditional approaches based on independent threads
                  exchanging messages, reducing the cost of
                  same-machine communication to nearly the lower bound
                  imposed by conventional hardware."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Threads are the vehicle for concurrency in many
                  approaches to parallel programming. Threads can be
                  supported either by the operating system kernel or
                  by user-level library code in the application
                  address space, but neither approach has been fully
                  satisfactory. This paper addresses this
                  dilemma. First, we argue that the performance of
                  kernel threads is inherently worse that that of
                  user-level threads, rather than this being an
                  artifact of existing implementations; managing
                  parallelism at the user level is essential to
                  high-performance parallel computing. Next, we argue
                  that the problems encountered in integrating
                  user-level threads with other system services is a
                  consequence of the lack of kernel support for
                  user-level threads provided by contemporary
                  multiprocessor operating systems; kernel threads are
                  the wrong abstraction on which to support user-level
                  management of parallelism. Finally, we describe the
                  design, implementation, and performance of a new
                  kernel interface and user-level thread package that
                  together provide the same functionality as kernel
                  threads without compromising the performance and
                  flexibility advantages of user-level management of
                  parallelism."

                  different levels of granularity, at different times,
                  or within different subsystems. These techniques may
                  include regulation of redundancy and resource
                  allocation, multiversion and multipath execution,
                  adjustments of program attributes such as time-out
                  periods and others. The management of software in
                  such systems is a difficult task. Software that may
                  be adapted to meet varying performance and
                  reliability requirements offers a solution. A

                  face the designer of such a package, and the
                  decisions we made. We describe the overall structure
                  of our RPC mechanism, our facilities for binding RPC
                  clients, the transport level communication protocol,
                  and some performance measures. We include
                  descriptions of some optimizations used to achieve
                  high performance and to minimize the load on server
                  machines that have many clients."

                  distributed subsystems and applications. Its novel
                  features include 1) a single object model that is

                  large, 2) support for abstract types, and 3) an
                  explicit notion of object location and
                  mobility. This paper outlines the goals of Emerald,
                  relates Emerald to previous work, and describes its
                  type system and distribution support. We are

  ABSTRACT =	 "Many parallel and concurrent applications cannot be

                  acceptable performance from some parallel
                  applications. For concurrent applications,
                  communication and synchronization performance can be
                  improved by taking advantage of application-specific
                  scheduling information. Mach's scheduler has been
                  enhanced to meet these challenges. Mach allows
                  concurrent programs to provide handoff and
                  discouragement hints to influence scheduling

                  BLINKBLT, is modified to use a cell format based

                  distinguish between the two protocols by the value
                  in the AAL length field, which becomes the BLINKBLT
                  PDU type field if higher than 48. This permits the
                  Data Link layer protocol to coexist with the
                  AAL. Optional forward error correction is also
                  added. The modified BLINKBLT is presented. The
                  BLITBLNK cell format is compatible with the proposed
                  AAL for VBR services, but its procedures are
                  different. It features cell-based loss recovery and
                  receiver-paced flow control. It provides
                  conenction-oriented OSI Data Link service in 2
                  sublayers, versus 3 when the AAL is used. Further

  ABSTRACT =	 "The advent of long haul, high-speed Asynchronous
                  Transfer Mode (ATM) networks introduces a ``backward
                  compatibility'' dilemma for existing higher-layer
                  communication protocols, {\em e.g.}, the TCP/IP
                  suite operating in the Internet environment. This
                  paper compares and contrasts four possible migration
                  paths to ATM-Internet interoperation: (1) integrate
                  ATM transparently below existing internetworking and
                  transport protocol layers, (2) create new special
                  purpose protocols designed specifically for ATM, (3)
                  extend existing protocol requirements to add support
                  for ATM, (4) design optional special-case
                  enhancements to existing protocols. It is difficult
                  to architect a clean solution that is both efficient
                  and backwardly compatible with existing
                  systems. Protocols designed for the current Internet
                  require general case assumptions, since it is
                  difficult to control possible end-to-end path
                  conditions. In the best case this adds redundancy,
                  in the worst case it degrades performance. Our
                  research group at University of California, Irvine
                  is currently developing an environment for analysis
                  and experimentation with various alternatives for
                  incorporating higher-layer internetworked
                  communication protocols with ATM. In order to
                  support development of protocol designs that
                  precisely meet application requirements and
                  underlying network characteristics, we are

  ABSTRACT =	 "The computer industry is converging on two
                  communications standards - OSI and SNA. OSI will be
                  used in multi-vendor environments such as factory
                  and office automation. SNA will be used to
                  communicate to corporate mainframes. UNIX systems
                  must be able to communicate fluently using both of
                  these standards and must provide a smooth migration
                  path to these standards from current proprietary and
                  national standards. The STREAMS facility of UNIX
                  System V Release 3 provides a powerful tool for
                  handling these problems. In this talk, Mr. Brown
                  will describe the properties of the STREAMS
                  technology which make it ideal for the
                  implementation of communication protocols. He will
                  illustrate how the building block approach
                  encouraged by this technology can be used to create
                  flexible communication architectures. He will
                  present examples showing how STREAMS can be used to
                  implement protocol independent services, to build
                  bridges between OSI and SNA and to accommodate
                  evolution in networking technology."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Berkeley UNIX 4.2 BSD is an operating system that
                  provides alternative ways for processes to
                  communicate with each other. User processes may
                  choose intermachine communications media, network
                  protocols, addressing families, and styles of
                  communication. In particular, user processes may use
                  datagram or stream communication. In this paper we
                  present a study of the performance achieved by user
                  processes when using the IPC mechanisms implemented
                  in Berkeley UNIX 4.2BSD in Ethernet based
                  environments. This study not only assesses the
                  impact that different processors, network hardware
                  interfaces, and Ethernets have on the communication
                  across machines, but also the effect of loading the
                  hosts and communication media that participate in
                  the interprocess communication mechanism. Our
                  measurements highlight the ultimate bounds on
                  performance that may be achieved by user process
                  applications communicating across machines, and
                  serve as a guide in designing performance critical
                  applications. Moreover, we present a detailed timing
                  analysis of the dynamic behavior of the TCP/IP and
                  the UDP/IP network communication protocols'
                  implementation in Berkeley UNIX 4.2 BSD. This
                  analysis sheds light on architectural constraints of
                  UNIX, on the tradeoffs encountered when software and
                  hardware perform the same actions on data (e.g.,
                  checksums) and when several buffering schemes
                  coexist at different levels in a system."

  ABSTRACT =	 "(tcplib) In this paper, we characterize wide-area
                  network applications that use the TCP transport
                  protocol. We also describe a new way to model the
                  wide-area traffic generated by a stub network. We
                  believe the traffic model presented here will be
                  useful in studying congestion control, routing
                  algorithms, and other resource management schemes
                  for existing and future networks. Our model is based
                  on trace analysis of TCP/IP wide-area internet
                  traffic. We collected the TCP/IP packet headers of
                  USC, UCB, and Bellcore networks at the point they
                  connect with their respective regional access
                  networks. We then wrote a handful of programs to
                  analyze the traces. Our model characterizes
                  individual TCP conversations by the distributions
                  of: number of bytes transferred, duration, number of
                  packets transferred, packet size, and packet
                  interarrival time. Our trace analysis shows that
                  both interactive and bulk transfer traffic from all
                  sites reflect a large number of short
                  conversations. Similarly, it show that a very large
                  percentage of traffic is bidirectional, even for
                  bulk transfer. We observed that interactive
                  applications send significantly different amounts of
                  data in each direction of a conversation, and that
                  interarrival times for interactive applications
                  closely follow a constant plus exponential
                  model. Half of the conversations are directed to a
                  handful of networks, but the other half are directed
                  to hundreds of networks. Many of these observations
                  contradict commonly held beliefs regarding wide-area
                  traffic."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Measurement is a significant part of reliable,
                  well-maintained computer operation. Measurements on
                  an individual computer can provide biling
                  information, determine when operation nears maximum
                  capacity, locate bottlenecks of a complex system,
                  etc. When a computer becomes part of a network,
                  measurement takes on added importance. Access to the
                  computer and its resources involves a large
                  community, making computer control more complex. The
                  network may see bursts of workload not previously
                  encountered or planned. Even though within
                  interconnected networks it it difficult to obtain
                  such information as the extent to which resources
                  are being used and which gateways are not operating
                  properly, it is important to monitor their
                  status. This article describes a model for managing
                  stand-along network measurement devices distributed
                  over an interconnected network (that is, a network
                  of networks). A host anywhere on the internet can
                  act as a controlling device that manages a scattered
                  set of measurement monitors. This article contains a
                  description of a protocol based on this model and an
                  explanation of the service it provides. The protocol
                  fits in the application layer of the OSI model."

                  Facility (LANSF) was modified to support virtual
                  circuit simulation, and then used to obtain the XTP
                  performance statistics. The chosen simulation LAN
                  environment was Ethernet. The analysis of XTP shows
                  that it can provide high throughput to transport
                  users for bulk data movement operations such as file
                  transfer. Its bandwidth for short transfers is
                  limited by the necessity of carrying the overhead of
                  packet headers, packet trailers, and acknowledgement
                  packets. however, it is no worse than most other
                  protocols in this respect."

                  cooperating processes on different machines, there
                  are many logical groups of processes. Examples
                  include the group of file servers, a group of

                  the user with access to computational resources
                  beyond that provided by his personal workstation. In
                  this paper, we describe the design and performance
                  of the remote execution facility in the V
                  distributed syste, as well as several implementation
                  issues of interest. In particular, we focus on
                  network transparency of the execution environment,
                  preemption and migration of dependencies on the
                  original host. We argue that preemptable remote
                  execution allows idle workstations to be used as a
                  ``pool of processors'' without interfering with use
                  by their owners and without significant overhead for
                  the normal execution of programs. In general, we
                  conclude that the cost of providing preemption is
                  modest compared to providing a similar amount of
                  computation service by dedicated ``computation
                  engines.''"

  ABSTRACT =	 "The Versatile Message Transaction Protocol {(VMTP)}
                  is a transport-level protocol designed to support
                  remote procedure call, multicast, and Real-time
                  communication. The protocol is designed for
                  efficient page-level network file access in
                  particular. This paper describes the significant
                  aspects of the VMTP design, including the VMTP
                  treatment of sessions, addressing, duplicate
                  suppression, flow control and retransmissions plus
                  its provision for multicast. The VMTP design
                  reflects a change in the use of computer
                  communication as well as a change in the underlying
                  hardware base for the next generation of
                  communication systems. It also challenges certain
                  established notions in the design of protocols."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Work to date on distributed systems has focused on
                  the correct choice of communication paradigm,
                  stressing (for example) message primitives, remote
                  procedure call, problem-oriented protocols, and so
                  on. A distributed system service is then implemented
                  as a module executing on a particular server machine
                  that is accessed using the communication
                  facilities. In contrast, the shared memory paradigm
                  has been used on multiprocessor and uniprocessor
                  systems. In the shared memory paradigm, the state of
                  a service is stored in shared memory and implemented
                  in a decentralized fashion across multiple
                  processors using this shared memory. This paper
                  describes a third paradigm for building systems,
                  namely problem-oriented shared
                  memory. Problem-oriented shared memory is memory
                  that is, for efficiency reasons, specialized for a
                  particular problem or application. Of particular
                  interest is the performance benefit of relaxing
                  strict shared memory consistency constraints,
                  replying on application-specific remedies to avoid
                  or handle the problems that can otherwise ensue. The
                  use of problem-oriented shared memory is illustrated
                  by describing several applications we are exploring
                  in the V distributed system. We also discuss basic
                  requirements on a communication system to support
                  this approach."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Communication systems are undergoing a change in use
                  from stream to request-response or transaction
                  communication. In addition, communication systems
                  are becoming increasingly based on high-speed, low
                  delay, low error rate channels. These changes call
                  for a new generation of networks, network
                  interfaces, and transport protocol design. The
                  performance characteristics of request-response
                  protocols on these high-performance networks should
                  guide the design of this new generation, yet
                  relatively little data of this nature is
                  available. In this paper, we present some
                  preliminary measurements of network traffic for a
                  cluster of workstations connected by Ethernet
                  running the V distributed operating system. We claim
                  that this system, with its use f a high-speed local
                  area network and a request-response transport
                  protocol tuned for RPC, provides some indications of
                  the performance characteristics fo systems in the
                  next generation of communication systems. In
                  particular, these measurements provide an indication
                  of network traffic patterns, usage characteristics
                  for request-response protocols, and the behavior of
                  the request-response protocol itself. These
                  measurements suggest in general that a key design
                  focus must be on minimizing network latency and that
                  a request-response protocol is well-suited for this
                  goal. This focus has implications for protocol
                  design and implementation as well as for the design
                  of networks and network interfaces."

                  services available in a distributed
                  environment. Ideally,the interface provides this
                  uniform access without excessive complexity in the
                  interface or loss of performance. However, a uniform
                  interface does not arise from careful design of
                  individual system interfaces alone; it requires
                  explicit definition. In this paper, the UIO (uniform
                  I/O) system interface that has been used for the
                  past five years in the V distributed operating
                  system is described, with the focus on the key
                  design issues. This interface provides several
                  extensions beyond the I/O interface of UNIX,
                  including support for record I/O, locking, atomic
                  transactions, and replication, as well as attributes
                  that indicate whether optional semantics and
                  operations are available. Experience in using and
                  implementing this interface with a variety of
                  different I/O services is described, along with the
                  performance of both local and network I/O. It is
                  concluded that the UIO interface provides a uniform
                  I/O system interface with significant functionality,
                  wide applicability, and no significant performance
                  penalty."

                  classes of protocols, previously largely

                  the domain over which naming systems must function
                  is growing to encompass the entire world. This paper
                  addresses the problem of a global naming system,
                  proposing a three-level naming architecture that
                  consists of global, administrational, and managerial

                  a decentralized approach to the lower levels, in
                  which naming is handled directly by the managers of
                  the named objects. Client-name caching and multicast
                  are exploited to implement name mapping with almost

  ABSTRACT =	 "Multicasting, the transmission of a packet to a
                  groupd of hosts, is an important service for
                  improving the efficiency and robustness of
                  distributed systems and applications. Although
                  multicast capability is available and widely used in
                  local area networks, when those LANs are
                  interconnected by store-and-forward routers, the
                  multicast service is usually not offered across the
                  resulting internetwork. To address this limitation,
                  we specify extensions to two common internetwork
                  routing algorithms -- distance-vector routing and
                  link-state routing -- to support low-delay datagram
                  multicasting beyond a single LAN. We also describe
                  modifications to the single-spanning-tree routing
                  algorithm commonly used by link-layer bridges, to
                  reduce the costs of multicasting in large extended
                  LANs. Finally, we discuss how the use of multicast
                  scope control and hierarchical multicast routing
                  allows the multicast service to scale up to large
                  internetworks."

                  distributed computer system. The principle, call the
                  end-to-end argument, suggests that functions placed
                  at low levels of a system may be redundant or of
                  little value when compared with the cost of
                  providing them at that low level. Examples discussed
                  in the paper include bit-error recovery, security
                  using encryption, duplicate message suppression,
                  recovery from system crashes, and delivery
                  acknowledgment. Low-level mechanisms to support
                  these functions are justified only as performance

  ABSTRACT =	 "When implementing a system specified as a number of
                  layers of abstraction, it is tempting to implement
                  each layer as a process. However, this requires that
                  communication between layers be via asynchronous
                  inter-process messages. Our experience, especially
                  with implementing network protocols, suggests that
                  asynchronous communication between layers leads to
                  serious performance problems. In place of this
                  structure we propose an implementation methodology
                  which permits synchronous (procedure call) between
                  layers, both when a higher layer invokes a lower
                  layer and in the reverse direction, from lower layer
                  upward. This paper discusses the motivation for this
                  methodology, as well as the pitfalls that accompany
                  it."

  ABSTRACT =	 "This paper describes a new model for constructing
                  distributed systems called the Remote Memory
                  Model. The remote memory model consists of several
                  client machines, one or more dedicated machines
                  called remote memory servers, and a communication
                  channel interconnecting them. In the remote memory
                  model, client machines share the memory resources
                  located on the remote memory server. Client machines
                  that exhaust their local memory move portions of
                  their address space to the remote memory server and
                  retrieve pieces as needed. Because the remote memory
                  server uses a machine-independent protocol to
                  communicate with client machines, the remote memory
                  server can support multiple heterogeneous client
                  machines simultaneously. This paper describes the
                  remote memory model and discusses the advantages and
                  issues of systems that use this model. It examines
                  the design of a highly efficient, reliable,
                  machine-independent protocol used by the remote
                  memory server to communicate with the client
                  machines. It also outlines the algorithms and data
                  structures employed by the remote memory server to
                  efficiently locate the date stored on the
                  server. Finally, it presents measurements of a
                  prototype implementation that clearly demonstrate
                  the viability and competitive performance of the
                  remote memory model."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Multicast or group communication is an important
                  part of modern distributed systems, but programming
                  language support for such communication is
                  uncommon. Remote procedure call uses a familiar
                  programming language abstraction to support unicast
                  request-response communication; what should the
                  corresponding abstraction be for multicast
                  communication? The essential and desirable
                  properties of a language construct for multicast
                  communication are presented first. Essential
                  properties include type safety, expressive power,
                  and efficiency. Desirable properties include use of
                  familiar control and data structures, appropriate
                  semantic level, and first-class treatment of
                  multicast operations in progress. The main
                  contribution of the paper is the introduction of a
                  spectrum of abstractions for multicast
                  communication, in increasing order of both
                  desirability and semantic level: functional mapping,
                  iterators, and streams. Examples of distributed
                  algorithms from the literature are used to
                  illustrate the expressive power of each
                  mechanism. Streams in particular provide first-class
                  status for multicast communication in progress, and
                  can be implemented efficiently in typical multicast
                  communication architectures."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Nectar is a ``network backplane'' for use in
                  heterogeneous multicomputers. The initial system
                  consists of a star-shared fiber-optic network with
                  an aggregate bandwidth of 1.6 gigabits/second and a
                  switching latency of 700 nanoseconds. The system can
                  be scaled up by connecting hundreds of these
                  networks together. The Nectar architecture provides
                  a flexible way to handle heterogeneity and
                  task-level parallelism. A wide variety of machines
                  can be connected as Nectar nodes and the Nectar
                  system software allows applications to communicate
                  at a high level. Protocol processing is off-loaded
                  to powerful communication processors so that nodes
                  do not have to support a suite of network
                  protocols. We have designed and built a prototype
                  Nectar system that has been operational since
                  November 1988. This paper describes its hardware and
                  software. The presentation emphasizes how the goals
                  influenced the design decisions and led to the novel
                  aspects of Nectar."

                  within local-area networks. ATM LANs can provide the
                  networking support needed for multimedia
                  communication at rates of 100 Mbits/sec and
                  higher. In this paper, we first analyze the protocol
                  processing required to handle ATM
                  communication. Based on this analysis, we then
                  discuss the architectural issues in the design of
                  host interfaces for ATM local-area networks. In
                  particular, we conclude that a simple host
                  interface, which leaves most of the ATM protocol
                  processing to be done by the host computer, supports
                  good performance for data communications (around 100
                  Mbits/sec). However, to support Real-time video and
                  audio communication, the ATM interface should
                  include an embedded processor."

  ABSTRACT =	 "A distributed operating system is a control program
                  running on a set of computers that are
                  interconnected by a network. This control program
                  unifies the different computers into a single
                  integrated compute and storage resource. Depending
                  on the facilities it provides, a distributed
                  operating system is classified as general purpose,
                  real time, or embedded. The need for distributed
                  operating systems stems from rapid changes in the
                  hardware environment in many organizations. Hardware
                  prices have fallen rapidly in the last decade,
                  resulting in the proliferation of workstations,
                  personal computers, data and compute servers, and
                  networks. This proliferation has underlined the need
                  for efficient and transparent management of these
                  physically distributed resources. This article
                  presents a paradigm for structuring distributed
                  operating systems, the potential and implications
                  this paradigm has for users, and research directions
                  for the future."

                  in communication system design by examining overall
                  system issues. In particular, we distinguish
                  physical multiplexing of resources from logical
                  multiplexing of streams. Both physical-resource
                  multiplexing and logical multiplexing determine the

                  system. We also discuss two issues affected by

                  in communication system design by examining overall
                  system issues. In particular, we distinguish
                  physical multiplexing of resources from logical
                  multiplexing of streams. Both physical-resource
                  multiplexing and logical multiplexing determine the
                  service that can be provided by a communication
                  system. We also discuss two issues affected by
                  logical multiplexing -- flow control and the
                  relationship between control and data streams of a
                  connection. We conclude that the granularity of the

  ABSTRACT =	 "Service rebalancing is a method for designing
                  programs that adhere to the client/server
                  model. Decisions about the division of labor between
                  client and server are made dynamically at runtime
                  rather than at design time. Service rebalancing may
                  improve performance, because the division of effort
                  is based upon an evaluation of the current
                  environment. Other benefits of service rebalancing
                  include on-the-fly updating of modules, a degree of
                  load balancing, sharing of code common to several
                  clients, encouragement of neatly modularized
                  programs, and the elimination of an absolute
                  division of effort between client and server. In
                  this paper, we discuss the benefits, problems, and
                  issues of service rebalancing. Our implementations,
                  Equanimity, is described in some detail. Finally, we
                  compare service rebalancing with previous work and
                  discuss future plans."

                  channels may be used to create a small-scale Gigabit
                  LAN to which these subsystems are attached as
                  nodes. The architectural focus of such a workstation
                  shifts towards its internal LAN. An attractive
                  attribute of this LAN is that its aggregate capacity
                  scales linearly with the number of nodes attached to
                  it. If this link-layer of the internal LAN is made
                  equivalent to the link-layer of the external LAN,
                  the interior nodes become directly accessible
                  externally. Except for latency the distinction
                  between whether a node is inside a workstation
                  versus outside it need not be significant. This
                  property is particularly attractive for distributed

  ABSTRACT =	 "It is anticipated that a ubiquitous data transport
                  system will require integration of local area and
                  wide area networks. The combined network will need
                  to present a uniform appearance to the user, be
                  effective as a transport mechanism for a great
                  variety of traffic patterns, and be economically
                  appropriate for a wide range of consumer
                  products. Learning from telephony and from
                  experiments with a local area network, we conclude
                  that the transport system must seek a clean
                  separation of function and protocol between the
                  network and its users. This separation is achieved
                  by a byte-stream architecture that carries control
                  and data bytes over switched virtual circuits. A
                  DATAKIT packet switch demonstrates how the
                  byte-stream concept can integrate local area and
                  wide area network objectives. This switch is an
                  assemble of interface modules connected by a pair of
                  short passive buses. Each type of interface module
                  serves one type of remote equipment and, if need be,
                  terminates the protocol of that equipment. There are
                  interface modules for trunks that lead to other
                  packet switches, for terminals, and for host
                  computers. Other modules provide system timing,
                  switching, network control, and maintenance
                  support."

  ABSTRACT =	 "A telecommunications network that is shared among
                  many users must transport information that
                  originates in many different protocols, embodies
                  many different data representations, and meets a
                  range of performance requirements. The data
                  structure that can simultaneously support all these
                  different needs is a byte stream in which each byte
                  is distinguished as a byte of user information or as
                  a byte of control information. A transport layer
                  protocol optimized for use in a byte stream network
                  is necessarily different from one in which the
                  indestructible unit of information is a packet. A
                  byte stream network has a different error
                  characteristic that implies a different method of
                  error detection, and the fine grain multiplexing
                  that is possible in a byte stream network leads to
                  new opportunities for performance optimization. The
                  Universal Receiver for Datakit networks is a
                  protocol engine that responds to commands which are
                  embedded in the incoming byte stream. By employing
                  transmitters that send different command sequences
                  and respond in various ways to the responses of the
                  Universal Receiver, one can efficiently achieve a
                  range of transport capabilities without loss of
                  connectivity among network users."

                  protocol designed to be an efficient means of
                  encapsulating transport protocols. It has also been
                  used successfully in its own right as a protocol for
                  data transport. Low queuing delay demands that
                  statistical multiplexors use relatively small
                  packets, but host computers show best throughput
                  when they work on large blocks of data. The
                  Universal Receiver Protocol is not packet oriented
                  so that it does not depend on the network choice of
                  packet size for efficient multiplexing. Instead, the
                  protocol is designed for a particular style of
                  pipelined receiver implementation that performs
                  block assemble in hardware and delivers completed
                  blocks to the host computer."

  ABSTRACT =	 "The communication speed in wide- metropolitan-, and
                  local-area networking has increased over the past
                  decade from Kbps lines to Gbps lines; i.e., six
                  orders of magnitude, while the processing speed of
                  commercial CPUs that can be employed as
                  communications processor has changed only two or
                  three orders of magnitude. This discrepancy in speed
                  translates to ``bottlenecks'' in the communications
                  process, because the software that supports some of
                  the high-level functionality of the communications
                  process is now several order of magnitude slower
                  than the transmission media. Moreover, the overhead
                  introduced by the operating system (OS) on the
                  communications process strongly affects the
                  application-to-application communication
                  performance. As a result, new proposals for
                  interface architecture have emerged that
                  considerably reduce the overhead associated with the
                  OS. With the alleviation of the OS bottleneck, the
                  performance required from the communication system
                  will be so high that a new protocol architecture
                  that will support high-performance (high-throughput
                  and low-delay) communication is needed. The purpose
                  of this paper is to propose an alternative structure
                  to the existing models of communication
                  architecture. The architecture presented employs an
                  approach quite different that that used in the
                  existing layered models, i.e., the proposed
                  architecture has a {\em horizontal} (parallel)
                  structure, as opposed to the {\em vertical} (serial)
                  structure of the layered models. The horizontal
                  structure, coupled with small number of layers,
                  results in elimination of unnecessary replication of
                  functions, unnecessary processing of functions, and
                  lowers the unnecessary interprocess communication
                  burden of the problem execution. (For examples,
                  unnecessary error detection for voice packets in
                  integrated applications and unnecessary error
                  detection in multiple layers for data applications
                  are eliminated, the overhead associated with multi
                  peer-to-peer connection of multi-layer architecture
                  is substantially reduced, etc.) Furthermore, the
                  proposed architecture lends itself more naturally
                  toward full parallel implementation. Parallelism
                  offers the potential of increased protocol
                  processing rates, reduction in processing latency,
                  and further reduction in processing overhead. And
                  with the advances in VLSI, full parallel
                  implementation becomes more and more feasible. Some
                  additional features of the proposed scheme include
                  {\em selective functionality}, which permits the
                  protocol to easily adjust itself to the kind of
                  performance demanded by the network-application
                  requirements. The architecture presented supports
                  the notion of communication networks that resemble
                  an extension of a computer bus, and are capable of
                  providing very high bandwidth, on the order of Gbps,
                  directly to the user."

                  increased over the past decade from kilobits per
                  second lines to hundreds of megabits per second;
                  {\em i.e.}, five orders of magnitude. The processing
                  speed of commercial CPUs that can be employed as
                  communications processors has changed only two to
                  three orders of magnitude. This discrepancy in speed
                  translates to ``bottlenecks'' in the communications

                  process is now several orders of magnitude slower
                  than the transmission media. In other words, when
                  the lines operated at 9.6 kb/s, the multilayer
                  conventional protocols implemented in software were
                  fast enough to match the speed of the
                  lines. However, when the lines operated at hundreds
                  of megabits per second, the mismatch in speed is so
                  large that the advantage of high-speed lines is
                  buried in the large processing overhead of
                  high-level protocols, leading to long delay and low
                  throughput. This change has shifted the bottleneck
                  from the transmission to the software processing at
                  the endpoints."

                  consisting of a number of hosts connected by a local
                  area network. The system model is based on the LOCUS
                  distributed file system. The LOCUS file system
                  allows replicated files, and the synchronization
                  policy is enforced by the use of the Centralized
                  Synchronization Sites (CSS). All requests to open a
                  file for access must be sent to the file's CSS which
                  checks for access conflicts. Our simulation model
                  allows process migration. The focus of this study is
                  on load balancing as applied to optimal process and
                  read site placement. An algorithm is proposed that
                  increases system performance through load
                  balancing. This algorithm uses data collected by the
                  system on which to base its decisions. The
                  characteristics of the algorithm and their effects
                  on system performance are analyzed and discussed.",

                  coordination problems that a protocol designer must
                  be able to recognize. It covers the basics of error
                  control, flow control, and protocol structuring, and
                  presents ten basic rules of protocol design. Part
                  two covers protocol specification and modeling
                  techniques, and introduces the notion of a protocol
                  validation model. Part three gives an overview of
                  protocol synthesis, conformance testing, and manual
                  and automated protocol validation techniques."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Gigabit networks are for near tomorrow with ATM
                  technology. However, several problems have not been
                  solved yet in order to allow successful multimedia
                  application development over these networks. This
                  paper deals with optimizations that should be made
                  on three different levels in order to ensure the
                  control of transmission at such a high speed. The
                  issue of how to design the MAC layer to pass $10^6$
                  packets per second at the host interface is first
                  presented. Then the problem of interconnecting high
                  speed networks is discussed and a network level
                  service model is described. Finally, the authors
                  propose a transport protocol designed to allow the
                  mix of voice, video and data on the same ATM
                  connection."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Emerald is an object-based language and system
                  designed for the construction of distributed
                  programs. An explicit goal of Emerald is support for
                  object mobility; objects in Emerald can freely move
                  within the system to take advantage of distribution
                  and dynamically changing environments. We say that
                  Emerald has fine-grained mobility because Emerald
                  objects can be small data objects as well as process
                  objects. Fine-grained mobility allows us to apply
                  mobility in new ways but presents implementation
                  problems as well. This paper discusses the benefits
                  of fine-grained mobility, the Emerald language and
                  run-time mechanisms that support mobility, and
                  techniques for implementing mobility that do not
                  degrade the performance of local
                  operations. Performance measurements of the current
                  implementation are included."

                  implementing remote procedure call (RPC) protocols
                  in the {\em x}-kernel. The exercise is intersting
                  because the RPC protocols exploit two novel design
                  techniques: virtual protocols and layered
                  protocols. These techniques are made possible
                  because the {\em x}-kernel provides an
                  object-oriented infrastructure that supports three
                  significant features: a uniform interface to all
                  protocols, a late binding between protocol layers,
                  and a small overhead for invoking any given protocol
                  layer. For each design technique, the paper
                  motivates the technique with a concrete example,
                  describes how it is applied to the implementation of
                  RPC protocols, and presents the results of
                  experiments designed to evaluate the technique."

                  primitives that make broadcast communication
                  available to user applications. In this paper we
                  introduce primitives for broadcast communication
                  that have been integrated with the Amoeba
                  distributed operating system. The semantics of the
                  broadcast primitives are simple and easy to
                  understand, but are still powerful. Our primitives,
                  for example, guarantee global ordering of broadcast
                  messages. The proposed primitives are also
                  efficient; a reliable broadcast can be done in just
                  slightly more than two messages, so, the performance
                  is comparable to a remote procedure call. In
                  addition, the primitives are flexible; user
                  applications can, for example, trade performance
                  against fault-tolerance."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Most modern network protocols give adequate support
                  for traditional applications such as file transfer
                  and remote login. Distributed applications, however,
                  have different requirements (e.g., efficient
                  at-most-once remote procedure call even in the face
                  of processor failures). To meet these new
                  requirements we have designed a new protocol, called
                  the Fast Local Internet Protocol (FLIP). FLIP is an
                  unreliable datagram protocol that provides both
                  point-to-point communication and multicast
                  communication, and requires almost no network
                  management. Furthermore, using FLIP we have
                  simplified higher-level protocols such as remote
                  procedure call and group communication, and enhanced
                  support for process migration and security. A
                  prototype implementation of FLIP has been built as
                  part of the new kernel for the Amoeba distributed
                  operating system. This implementation demonstrates
                  that FLIP is not only better suited for distributed
                  computing than existing protocols, but is more
                  efficient as well."

                  multiprocessor nodes requires significant
                  improvements over conventional host-to-network
                  adapters. Current host-to-network adapter interfaces
                  impose excessive processing, system bus and
                  interrupt overhead on a multiprocessor host. Current
                  network adapters are either limited in function,
                  wasting key resources such as the system bus and the
                  processors, or else intelligent but too slow,
                  because of complex transport protocols and because
                  of an inadequate internal memory
                  architecture. Conventional transport protocols are
                  too complex for hardware implementation and too slow
                  without it. --- In this paper, we describe the
                  design of a network adapter board for the VMP
                  multiprocessor machine that addresses these
                  issues. The adapter uses a host interface that is
                  designed for minimal latency, minimal interrupt
                  processing overhead and minimal system bus and
                  memory access overhead. The network adapter itself
                  has a novel internal memory and processing
                  architecture that implements some of the key
                  performance-critical transport layer functions in
                  hardware. This design is integrated with VMTP, a new
                  transport protocol specifically designed for
                  efficient implementation on an intelligent
                  high-performance network adapter. Although targeted
                  for the VMP system, the design is applicable to
                  other multiprocessors as well as uni-processors.",

  ABSTRACT =	 "A major reason for the rarity of distributed
                  applications, despite the proliferation of networks,
                  is the sensitivity of their performance to various
                  aspects of the network environment. We demonstrate
                  that distributed applications can run faster than
                  local ones, using common hardware. We also show that
                  the primary factors affecting performance are, in
                  approximate order of importance: speed of the user's
                  workstation, speed of the remote host (if any), and
                  the high-level (above the transport level) protocols
                  used. In particular, the use of batching,
                  pipelining, and structure in high-level protocols
                  reduces the degradation often experienced between
                  different bandwidth networks. Less significant, but
                  still noticeable improvements result from proper
                  design and implementation of the underlying
                  transport protocols. Ultimately, with proper
                  application of these techniques, network bandwidth
                  is rendered virtually insignificant."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Clouds is a distributed operating system that runs
                  on general purpose computers connected via a
                  local-area network. The system is composed of
                  compute servers, data servers, and user
                  workstations. It implements an object-thread model
                  of computation that is based on the object-oriented
                  programming concepts. Clouds supports course-grained
                  objects that provide long term storage for
                  persistent data and associated code. Lightweight,
                  concurrent threads provide support for computational
                  activity through the code in the objects. Persistent
                  objects and threads give rise to a programming
                  environment composed of shared permanent memory,
                  dispensing with the need for facilities such as file
                  systems. Though the hardware may be distributed,
                  Clouds provides applications with a logically
                  centralized system, based on a shared
                  ``single-level'' store. The implementation of Clouds
                  separates the operating system policies from the
                  mechanisms used to implement them. The structure of
                  Clouds is a three-level hierarchy. The lowest level
                  is a minimalist kernel that provides mechanisms for
                  memory and processor control. At the next level, a
                  set of trusted system-objects provide low-level
                  operating system services. High-level services are
                  implemented at the top level in application
                  objects."

  ABSTRACT =	 "The telecommunications community often considers
                  data needs as being satisfied by virtual circuits
                  based upon connections. Circuit-switched 56-kb/s
                  data service is a case in point. This is reasonable
                  from an evolutionary or integrated services
                  perspective. Furthermore, until recently this view
                  has been supported by some data people as
                  well. Terminal-timesharing, transaction-based, and
                  mainframe-to-mainframe computing systems can be
                  served by such networks. However, the computing
                  community has recently evolved an additional
                  computer systems paradigm often referred to as the
                  ``client-server'' model. Fueled by the explosive
                  growth of both personal computers and Local Area
                  Networks (LANs), computing systems based on this
                  model are flourishing. The data communications needs
                  of these systems are currently being satisfied by
                  low-delay, connectionless networks with broadcast
                  capabilities (e.g., LANS). Such networks provide
                  services that are substantially different from
                  virtual circuit networks."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Increasingly, powerful and inexpensive computers are
                  situated near individual users, and these computers
                  are linked together either locally or across long
                  distances. The computers are heterogeneous because
                  users require different capabilities; legislating
                  the use of identical systems in any organization
                  seems as unlikely in the future as it has been in
                  the past. Together with parallel processing,
                  heterogeneity and distribution are likely to be the
                  dominant characteristics of computer systems during
                  the next decade. The advent of distributed,
                  heterogeneous systems has led to some new
                  problems. One particularly important problem is the
                  lack of support for sharing of programs and data in
                  a safe and convenient manner across a heterogeneous
                  network. Our research is aimed at correcting this
                  problem by provision of a language-independent
                  object repository. The repository can be used by
                  programs written in different programming languages,
                  and running on different hardware and under
                  different operating systems, to share
                  information. The new repository will be language
                  independent, will store typed, structured objects,
                  will support atomic transactions, will be both
                  highly reliable and highly available, will control
                  access to its objects, will perform well, and will
                  be scalable, so that it can support a wide range of
                  system sizes."

  ABSTRACT =	 "A computing environment consisting of workstations
                  connected by a local area network is now
                  common. Often these workstations are assigned to
                  individual users, and thus represent a significant
                  unused resource when those individuals are not
                  working. Remote Unix, (RU) uses these idle
                  workstations to execute compute-bound jobs in the
                  background. Users submit jobs to RU from their own
                  workstations. The jobs are queued, and eventually
                  executed remotely on idle workstations. When their
                  jobs have completed, users are notified by mail. The
                  owner of a workstation has absolute priority over RU
                  jobs. When the owner initiates interactive or other
                  non-RU work, any RU job is automatically
                  checkpointed and restarted on another
                  workstation. RU jobs may go through any number of
                  checkpoints before eventual completion. Finding idle
                  workstations, handling of remote system calls, and
                  checkpointing when necessary are all handled by the
                  RU software without intervention from users. In
                  addition to providing ``free'' cycles, RU allows
                  completion of very long running jobs which might
                  otherwise be aborted by system crashes and
                  shutdowns. The longest running job so far has
                  completed successfully after accumulating 60 CPU
                  days over a 3 month period. This paper describes the
                  computing environment for which RU was designed, and
                  current limitations on the class of jobs it can
                  handle. The three main components of RU, remote
                  system call handling, a general UNIX checkpointing
                  facility, and distributed spooling and control are
                  each discussed. The current version of RU supports
                  on single process jobs. Possible extensions are
                  discussed."

  ABSTRACT =	 "The Synthesis distributed operating system combines
                  efficient kernel calls with a high-level, orthogonal
                  interface. The key concept is the use of a code
                  synthesizer in the kernel to generate specialized
                  (thus short and fast) kernel routines for specific
                  situations. We have three methods of synthesizing
                  code: Factoring Invariants to bypass redundant
                  computations; Collapsing Layers to eliminate
                  unnecessary procedure calls and context switches;
                  and Executable Data Structures to shorten data
                  structure traveral time. Applying these methods, the
                  kernel call synthesized to read /dev/mem takes about
                  15 microseconds on a 68020 machine. A simple model
                  of computation call a {\em synthetic machine}
                  supports paralle and distributed processing. The
                  interface to synthetic machine consists of six
                  operations on four kinds of objects. This
                  combination of a high-level interface with a code
                  synthesizer avoids the traditional trade-off in
                  operating systems between powerful interfaces and
                  efficient implementations."

                  code synthesis reduces the execution path for
                  frequently used kernel calls. Optimistic
                  synchronization increases concurrency within the

  ABSTRACT =	 "We describe an implementation of a fine-grain
                  adaptive scheduling mechanism, based on {\em
                  software feedback.} Conventional scheduling makes
                  job assignment exclusively a function of time. We
                  broaden the meaning of the term ``scheduling'' to
                  include job assignment as a function of a sequence
                  of events, such as timer interrupts, I/O operations,
                  queue overflow/underflow, and system call traps. Our
                  implementation of software feedback in the Synthesis
                  operating system is analogous to the hardware phase
                  locked loop. Very low overhead context switches and
                  scheduling cost (a few microseonds on a 68020-based
                  machine) makes this implementation useful to
                  practical applications such as digital signal
                  processing. Since scheduling actions and policy
                  adjustments occur at a very fine granularity
                  (sub-millisecond intervalues) Synthesis adaptive
                  scheduling is very sensitive. Interesting
                  applications of fine-grain adaptive scheduling
                  include I/O device management, Real-time scheduling,
                  and distributed adaptive scheduling."

                  Input/Output processing modules within the UNIX
                  System V kernel. Initially developed by Dennis
                  Ritchies at AT\&T Bell Labs, STREAMS provides a
                  structure to the character I/O subsystem that
                  encourages modular software design. Furthermore, it
                  simplifies the design of I/O architectures by
                  providing standard mechanisms and interfaces at both
                  the system call level and within the UNIX System
                  kernel. A {\em stream} is a full-duplex processing
                  and data transfer path between a STREAMS driver and
                  a process in user space. It allows user programs to
                  configure intermediate STREAMS processing modules on
                  the {\em stream} dynamically. The concept of pushing
                  intermediate processing modules on a {\em stream} in
                  kernel space is analogous to chaining UNIX System
                  commands together via the pipe mechanism in user
                  space. These attributes have made STREAMS attractive
                  as the foundation for implementing network protocols
                  and services in System V. In this talk, Mr. McGrath
                  will describe the streams mechanism from the
                  implementor's point of view. He will present many
                  examples illustrating how the streams mechanism can
                  be used to solve a wide range of problems. "

  ABSTRACT =	 "The 4.3BSD UNIX kernel uses many memory allocation
                  mechanisms, each designed for the particular needs
                  of the utilizing subsystem. This paper describes a
                  general purpose dynamic memory allocator that can be
                  used by all of the kernel subsystems. The design of
                  this allocator takes advantage of known memory usage
                  patterns in the UNIX kernel and a hnybrid strategy
                  that is time-efficient for small allocations and
                  space-efficient for large allocations. This
                  allocator replaces the multiple memory allocation
                  interfaces with a single easy-to-program interface,
                  results in more efficient use of global memory by
                  eliminating partitioned and specialized memory
                  pools, and is quick enough that no performance loss
                  is observed relative to the current
                  implementations. The paper concludes with a
                  discussion of our experience in using the new memory
                  allocator, and directions for future work."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Amoeba is the distributed system developed at the
                  Free University (VU) and the Centre for Mathematics
                  and Computer Science (CWI), both in
                  Amsterdam. Throughout the project's ten-year
                  history, a major concern of the designers has been
                  to combine the research themes of distributed
                  systems, such as high availability, use of
                  parallelism and scalability, with simplicity and
                  high performance. Distributed systems are
                  necessarily more complicated than centralized
                  systems, so they have a tendency to be much
                  slower. Amoeba was always designed to be used, so it
                  was deemed essential to achieve extremely high
                  performance. The Amoeba software is based on
                  objects. An objects is a piece of data on which
                  well-defined operations may be performed by
                  authorized users, independent of where the user and
                  object are located. Objects are managed by server
                  processes and named using capabilities chosen
                  randomly from a sparse name space. Processes consist
                  of a segmented address space shared by one or more
                  threads of control. Processes can be created,
                  managed, and debugged remotely. Operations on
                  objects are implemented using remote procedure
                  calls. Amoeba has a unique and fast file system. The
                  file system is split into two parts - the Bullet
                  Service, which stores immutable files contiguously
                  on the disk and the SOAP Directory Service, which
                  provides a mechanism for giving capabilities
                  symbolic names. The directory server also handles
                  replication and atomicity, eliminating the need for
                  a separate transaction management system."

                  an application of the system known as gypsy servers,

  ABSTRACT =	 "The Sun Network Fil System (NFS) is a popular
                  protocol to access files across a network. NFS is
                  implemented on machines as different as Personal
                  Computers and Cray-2 supercomputers. It uses Sun
                  Remote Procedure Call and External Data
                  Representation specifications, which can be used on
                  a variety of transport protocols. The original
                  design goal for NFS was to support small clusters of
                  machines on local area networks. Thus a datagram
                  protocol (UDP) was chosen to simplify
                  transport. Using a connectionless transport protocol
                  meant that nothing explicitly needed to be done to
                  handle server or network failures. However, the use
                  of NFS has expanded to cover much larger and more
                  complicated networks than was ever anticipated. This
                  has caused some NFS users to experience the problems
                  of congestion and flow control that transport
                  protocols have been designed to address. This paper
                  discusses some alternatives for NFS transport
                  protocols. Other issues, such as inter-domain
                  authentication, are not discussed here."

                  networks. In contrast to other proposals that argue
                  that layering is the bane of efficiency, this
                  approach is based on a highly layered architecture,
                  in fact, one with more layers than even conventional
                  network architectures. The key justification for
                  multiple layers is that it provides application
                  programmers with the most flexibility in selecting
                  exactly the right functionality for their
                  application. In addition to presenting the
                  architecture, the paper also describes several
                  aspects of its implementation, including use of a
                  new technique called lazy messages, that allow the
                  architecture to achieve the same performance
                  advantages as architectures that have abandoned
                  layers."

  ABSTRACT =	 "A transparent blast facility provides a flexible
                  solution to the problem of achieving high
                  user-to-user throughput in a heterogeneous
                  network. The facility achieves high throughput by
                  avoiding the cost of copying large messages across
                  the user/kernel boundary. The facility is
                  transparent in that it simultaneously supports a
                  wide variety of protocols, it is not embedded in or
                  restricted to any one protocol. This paper describes
                  the kernel mechanisms and algorithms that make up
                  the transparent blast facility. It also shows that
                  for several RPC protocols, the facility supports
                  effective user-to-user throughput rates to within 87
                  percent of kernel-to-kernel throughput rates."

                  Genesis and Avoca, that are successful examples of
                  software components/building-block technologies and
                  domain modeling. Building-block technologies exploit
                  large-scale reuse, reply on open architecture
                  software, and elevate the granularity of programming
                  to subsystem level. Domain modeling formalizes the
                  similarities and differences among systems of a
                  domain. We believe our model is a blue-print for

  ABSTRACT =	 "The design of Medusa, a distributed operating system
                  for the Cm* multimicroprocessor, is discussed. The
                  Cm* architecture combines distribution and sharing
                  in a way that strongly impacts he organization of
                  operating systems. Medusa is an attempt to
                  capitalize on the architectural features to produce
                  a system that is module, robust, and efficient. To
                  provide modularity and to make effective use of the
                  distributed hardware, the operating system is
                  partitioned into several disjoint utilities that
                  communicate with each other via messages. To take
                  advantage of the parallelism present in Cm* and to
                  provide robustness, all programs, including the
                  utilities, are task forces containing many
                  concurrent, cooperating activities."

                  associates with each process a distinguished home
                  node, which provides kernel services to the process
                  throughout the process's lifetime. System calls that
                  depend on the location of a process are forwarded to
                  the process's home node. Performance measurements
                  based on a few simple benchmarks show that remote
                  execution using the home-node model is efficient as
                  long as the number of system calls that must be
                  forwarded home is small; this appears to be the case
                  as long as file system related calls can be handled
                  without involving the home node."

  ABSTRACT =	 "A pseudo-device is a mechanism in the Sprite network
                  file system that lets a user-level server process
                  emulate a file or I/O device. Pseudo-devices are
                  accessed like regular files or devices, and they
                  exist in the file system name space. Pseudo-devices
                  are implemented by transparently mapping client
                  operations on the pseudo-device into a
                  request-response exchange with a server process. The
                  interface to pseudo-devices is general enough to be
                  a transport mechanism for a user-level RCP
                  system. It also provides a stream-oriented interface
                  with write-behind and read-ahead for an asynchronous
                  connection between clients and server. Sprite uses
                  pseudo-devices to implement at user level its
                  terminal drivers, the internet protocol suite, and
                  the X-11 window system server. The pseudo-device
                  implementation provides as fast or faster
                  communication, both local and remote, than a UNIX

  ABSTRACT =	 "The Sprite operating system uses copy-on-write
                  during process creation. The mechanism is a
                  combination of copy-on-write (COW) and
                  copy-on-reference (COR), which simplifies the
                  implementation and reduces the cache flushing
                  overhead on machines with virtually-addressed
                  caches. The COW-COR mechanism can potentially
                  improve fork performance over copy-on-fork schemes
                  from 10 to 100 times depending on whether pages are
                  resident in memory or on backing store. However, in
                  normal use more than 70 percent of the pages have to
                  be copied anyway. With the Sprite implementation the
                  overhead of handling the additional page faults
                  required results in worse overall performance than
                  copy-on-fork; with a more optimized implementation
                  forks would be about 20 percent faster with COW-COR
                  than with copy-on-fork. A pure copy-on-write scheme
                  would eliminate 10 to 2- percent of the page copies
                  required under COW-COR and would provide up to a 20
                  percent improvement in fork performance over
                  COW-COR. However, because of extra cache-flushing
                  overhead on machines with virtually-addressed
                  caches, copy-on-write may have worse overall
                  performance than COW-COR on these types of
                  machines."

  ABSTRACT =	 "The Sprite operating system allows executing
                  processes to move between hosts at any time. We use
                  this process migration mechanism to off load work
                  onto idle machines, and also to evict migrated
                  processes when idle workstations are reclaimed by
                  their owners. Sprite's migration mechanism provides
                  a high degree of transparency for migrated processes
                  and for users. Idle machines are identified, and
                  eviction is invoked, automatically by daemon
                  processes. On Sprite it takes up to a few hundred
                  milliseconds on SPARCstation workstations to perform
                  remote execution, while evictions typically occur in
                  a few seconds. The pmake program uses remote
                  invocation to invoke tasks
                  concurrently. Compilations commonly obtain speedup
                  factors in the range of three to six; they are
                  limited primarily to contention for centralized
                  resources such as file servers. CPU-bound tasks such
                  as simulations can make more effective use of idle
                  hosts, obtaining as much as eight-fold
                  speedups. Process migration has been in regular
                  service for years."

                  systems, Amoeba and Sprite. Although the systems
                  share many goals, they diverge on two philosophical
                  grounds; whether to emphasize a distributed
                  computing model or traditional UNIX-style
                  application, and whether to use a
                  workstation-centered model of computation or a
                  combination of terminals and a shared processor
                  pool. Many of the most prominent features of the
                  system (both positive and negative) follow from the
                  philosophical differences. For example, Amoeba
                  provides a high-performance user-level IPC
                  mechanism, while Sprite's RPC mechanism is only
                  available for kernel use; Sprite's file access
                  performance benefits from client-level caching,
                  while Amoeba caches files only on servers; and
                  Sprite uses a process migration model to share
                  compute power, while Amoeba uses a centralized
                  server to allocate processors and distribute load
                  automatically."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Network management is rapidly becoming one of the
                  most pressing problems in data
                  communications. Networks continue to grow at a rapid
                  pace, and their sheer size requires us to have
                  effective network management tools. Yet a variety of
                  critical network management issues remain the
                  subject of debate and disagreement among
                  researchers, and we are some distance from
                  developing a set of network management
                  standards. This survey identifies key areas of
                  agreement and disagreement in the network management
                  community, using the evolving OSI network management
                  architecture as an informal guide. A key observation
                  is that the open-networking community has apparently
                  settled on a management model that places a
                  management information base (MIB) on each network
                  node and manages this MIBs remotely with application
                  level protocols. Various network systems based on
                  this model are examined, along with some systems
                  that use alternative management architectures."

  ABSTRACT =	 "This paper describes a research effort concerned
                  with the design of the next generation of internet
                  architecture, which has been necessitated by two
                  emerging trends. First, there will be at least a few
                  orders of magnitude increase in data rates of
                  communication networks in the next few years. For
                  example, researchers are already prototyping
                  networks with data rates of up to a few hundred
                  Mbps, and are planning networks with data rates up
                  to a few Gbps. Second, researchers from all
                  disciplines of science, engineering, and humanities
                  plan to use the communication infrastructure to
                  access widely distributed resources in order to
                  solve bigger and more complex problems. These trends
                  provide new challenges and opportunities to
                  researchers in the communication field. One such
                  challenge is the design of what we call the very
                  high speed internet (VHSI) abstract which can help
                  efficiently support guaranteed levels of performance
                  for a variety of applications, and can cope with the
                  ever increasing diversity of underlying networks
                  with rapidly growing user population and needs. Our
                  strategy towards achieving this ambitious goal
                  comprises the following: (1) design, specify, and
                  prototype implementation of a novel multipoint
                  congram-oriented service that can work well with
                  connection-oriented and datagram high speed
                  networks, can provide variable grade service on a
                  need basis to its applications, and can provide
                  adequate reconfigurability to deal with
                  survivability requirements due to network
                  failures. (2) design and implement gateway
                  architectures that can support data rates of a few
                  hundred Mbps, can interface with diverse networks,
                  and can implement the congram-oriented service
                  without becoming a performance bottleneck. (3)
                  develop analytical and simulation models to evaluate
                  important tradeoffs associated with the design of a
                  congram-oriented protocol, the resource management
                  on diverse networks, and the design of new gateway
                  architectures."

  ABSTRACT =	 "This paper describes the general problems in
                  providing system software support for multimedia
                  applications. It specifically focuses on
                  applications that have Digital Continuous Media
                  (DCM) I/O components, and the type of support that
                  must be provided by the network software and
                  operating system. DCM applications have large
                  bandwidth and low delay requirements. Network
                  software support to meet these requirements is
                  discussed, e.g., resource reservation schemes based
                  on parameterized requests for some level of quality
                  of service. Since most DCM communications will be
                  long-lived, connections are the appropriate network
                  construct for these communications. Operating system
                  support is discussed in terms of Real-time resource
                  scheduling, synchronization or processes, and
                  temporally related DCM flows, shared memory, and the
                  need for a modular, uniform I/O
                  abstraction. Finally, the paper presents design
                  principles based on the concepts of moving processes
                  to data and separating design from implementation as
                  important considerations for system software

  ABSTRACT =	 "When processes in a network communicate, the
                  messages they exchange define a partial ordering of
                  externally visible events. While the significance of
                  this partial order in distributed computing is well
                  understood, it has not been made an explicit part of
                  the communication substrate upon which distributed
                  programs are implemented. This paper describes a new
                  interprocess communication mechanism, called Psync,
                  that explicitly encodes this partial ordering with
                  each message. The paper shows how Psync can be
                  efficiently implemented on an unreliable
                  communications network, and it demonstrates how
                  conversations serve as an elegant foundation for
                  ordering messages exchanged in a distributed
                  computation and for recovering from processor
                  failures."

  ABSTRACT =	 "This paper describes a communication substrate,
                  called Consul, upon which fault-tolerant distributed
                  systems can be built. Consul facilitates the
                  development of such systems by providing various
                  fault-tolerant services for constructing programs
                  based on the replicated state machine
                  approach. These services include a broadcast
                  service, a membership service, and a recovery
                  service. Consul is unique in two repsects. First,
                  its services are implemented using a collection of
                  algorithms that exploit the partial ordering of
                  messages exchanged in the system. Such algorithms
                  are generally more efficient than those that depend
                  on total ordering of events. Second, its underlying
                  architecture is configurable. That is, the
                  application configures Consul from a collection of
                  building block protocols, including protocols for
                  ordering messages, detecting failure, agreeing on
                  membership, and restoring the state of a failed
                  process. The paper sketches Consul's architecture,
                  presents the algorithms used by its protocols, and
                  reports on the performance of an implementation in
                  the {\em x}-kernel."

                  instructions even though the protocol stack is not
                  determined until runtime. This supports
                  divide-and-conquer simplification of the programming
                  task by minimizing the penalty for decomposing
                  complex protocols into combinations of simpler
                  protocols."

  ABSTRACT =	 "An important issue in the design of host-network
                  interfaces is how much protocol processing should be
                  done is hardware ({\em i.e.}, on the network device)
                  and how much should be done in software ({\em i.e.},
                  on the host). This issue is becoming increasingly
                  important as improving network performance puts more
                  and more stress on the end host. As a result, there
                  have recently been several efforts to experiment
                  with different points in the design spectrum: (1)
                  Nectors communications adaptor board (CAB); (2)
                  Aurora gigabit network testbed; (3) Network Adaptor
                  Board. Each of these architectures implements one or
                  more protocols on the network device -- in the case
                  of CAB it is an entire protocol suite; in the case
                  of NAB, it is a single high-level transport
                  protocol, and in the case of Aurora, it is a single
                  low-level protocol. This paper introduces another
                  point in the design spectrum: the {\em
                  x}-chip. Rather than implement one or more protocols
                  on the network device, the x-chip implements a
                  collection of protocol-independent functions on the
                  network device. The x-chip does not replace the
                  software implementations of protocols; it just
                  provides hardware assist to these protocols. The
                  functions provided are simple enough that they can
                  be implemented by specialized chips; general purpose
                  processors are not used in the design. The x-chip is
                  an outgrowth of our work on the x-kernel -- a
                  sofware architecture that supports protocol
                  implementations. one of the design philosophies of
                  the x-kernel has been to identify tasks that are
                  common to all protocols, and to provide general
                  tools that support these tasks. The x-chip takes
                  this philosophy one step further by moving certain
                  aspects of the support tools into hardware, with the
                  ultimate goal of vertically integrating the network
                  device and the network software infrastructure."

                  proposals which introduce a predetermined protocol
                  hierarchy, the configuration is dynamic in the sense
                  that an application can specify requirements of the
                  underlying services and the configuration of a
                  protocol is done with respect to these
                  requirements. The approach discussed in this paper
                  introduces a model for the configuration of
                  protocols comprising of three layers: application,
                  end-to-end communications and transport
                  infrastructure layer. The dynamic configuration
                  takes place in the end-to-end communications
                  layer. The emphasis of the paper is on the
                  description of the model, a notation for the
                  description of applications requirements, and the
                  configuration of protocol entities. The approach is
                  particularly well-suited to make use of any progress
                  in the implementation of protocol functions."

                  is inevitable between good structure and good
                  performance. Although a layered architecture has
                  been proposed for open communications, it is
                  generally unknown as how the layer entities ought to
                  be structured and what are appropriate strategies
                  that couple be adopted in implementations. This
                  paper examines a number of possible implementation
                  strategies using the various prevailing system
                  facilities: processes, threads, kernel and front-end
                  processors. The procs and cons of the strategies are
                  analyzed showing their relative merits in
                  implementations. The analysis leads to the
                  recommendation of an enhanced subsystem architecture
                  that holds the best compromise of the conflicting
                  requirements of modularity and efficiency."

                  system by providing protected communication
                  capabilities called Ports. The local port-based
                  communication abstraction can be extended over a
                  network by Network Server tasks. The network servers
                  effectively act as local representatives for remote
                  tasks by implementing an abstraction of Network
                  Ports. To extend the security of the port-based
                  communication abstraction into the network
                  environment, the network servers must protect both
                  the messages sent over the network to network ports
                  and the access rights to network ports. This paper

                  Network Operating System, its predecessor, the
                  University of Rochester RIG system and its successor
                  CMU's Mach multiprocessor operating system. It
                  outlines the major design decisions on which the
                  Accent Kernel was based, how those decisions evolved
                  from the RIG experiences and how they had to be
                  modified to properly handle general purpose
                  multiprocessors in Mach. It also discusses some of
                  the major issues in the implementation of
                  message-based systems and the usage patterns
                  observed with Accent over a three year period of use

  ABSTRACT =	 "An important component of the Mach design is the use
                  of memory objects which can be managed either by the
                  kernel or by user programs through a message
                  interface. This feature allows applications such as
                  transaction management systems to participate in
                  decisions regarding secondary storage management and
                  page replacement. This paper explores the goals,
                  design and implementation of Mach and its external
                  memory management facility. The relationship between
                  memory and communication in Mach is examined as it
                  related to overall performance, applicability of
                  Mach to new multiprocessor architectures, and the
                  structure of application programs."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Code to implement network protocols can be either
                  inside the kernel of an operating system or in
                  user-level processes. Kernel-resident code is hard
                  to develop, debug, and maintain, but user-level
                  implementations typically incur significant overhead
                  and perform poorly. The performance of user-level
                  network code depends on the mechanism used to
                  demultiplex received packets. Demultiplexing in a
                  user-level process increases the rate of context
                  switches and system calls, resulting in poor
                  performance. Demultiplexing in the kernel eliminates
                  unnecessary overhead. This paper describes the
                  packet filter, a kernel-resident,
                  protocol-independent packet
                  demultiplexer. Individual user processes have great
                  flexibility in selecting which packets they will
                  receive. Protocol implementations using the packet
                  filter perform quite well, and have been in
                  production use for several years."

                  system designed for high performance interactions
                  between clients and servers using the well-known RPC
                  model. The paper starts out by describing the
                  architecture of the Amoeba system, which is typified
                  by specialized components such as workstations,
                  several services, a processor pool, and gateways the
                  connect other Amoeba systems transparently over
                  wide-area networks. Next the RPC interface is
                  described. The paper presents performance
                  measurements of the Amoeba RPC on unloaded and
                  loaded systems. The time to perform the simplest RPC
                  between two user processes has been measureed to be
                  1.4 msec. Compared to SUN 3/50's RPC, Amoeba has 1/9
                  the delay, and over 3 times the throughput. Finally,
                  the Amoeba file server is described. The Amoeba file
                  server is fast enough that its performance is
                  limited by the communication bandwidth. The authors
                  claim this is the fastest file server available
                  (mostly because it doesn't store files in blocks,
                  IMHO!)."

                  end-to-end transport protocol that is capable of
                  high throughput consistent with the evolving
                  wideband physical networks based on fiber optic
                  transmission lines and high capacity
                  switches. Unlike the current transport protocols in
                  which changes in control/state information are
                  exchanged between the two communicating entities
                  only when some significant event occurs, our
                  protocol exchanges relevant and full state
                  information periodically, routinely, and
                  frequently. We show that this results in reducing
                  the complexity of protocol processing by removing
                  many of the procedures required to recover from the
                  inadequacies of the network such as bit-errors,
                  packet loss, out of sequence packets, and makes it
                  more amenable to parallel processing. Also, to
                  increase channel utilization in the presence of high
                  sped, long latency networks, and to support
                  datagrams, we propose an efficient implementation of
                  selective repeat method of error control used in our
                  protocol. Thus, we utilize small extra bandwidth to
                  simplify protocol processing; a trade-off that
                  appears proper since electronic speeds for protocol
                  processing are far slower than fiber transmission
                  rates. Our preliminary estimates indicate that
                  20,000 packet/second can be handled in a completely
                  software implementation on a 10 MIP microprocessor
                  using 8 percent of its cycles."

                  Engines Incorporated. Current transport layer
                  protocols such as DoD's Transmission Control
                  Protocol (TCP) and ISO's Transport Protocol were not
                  designed for the next generation of high speed,
                  interconnected reliable networks such as FDDI and
                  the gigabit/second wide area networks. Unlike all

                  designed to be implemented in hardware as a VLSI
                  chip set. By streamlining the protocol, combining
                  the transport and network layers and utilizing the
                  increased speed and parallelization possible with a
                  VLSI implementation, XTP will be able to provide the

  ABSTRACT =	 "This paper concerns the analysis of networks and how
                  their communication patterns can be applied to the
                  design of a virtual circuit packet switch. The
                  future of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks
                  depends on the design and development of virtual
                  circuit packet switches. The performance
                  requirements of ATM switches can be estimated by
                  measurements of current data communication
                  networks. Previous network studies do not provide an
                  adequate model of conversations between hosts, an
                  issue of relevance to circuit establishment in
                  virtual circuit packet switches. Virtual circuit
                  switches route a conversation consisting of
                  sequences of packets along a unique path through a
                  network. A model for such data conversations can be
                  determined from data traffic using a
                  connection-oriented protocol in existing
                  networks. However, many of the network services
                  offered on current networks depend on a
                  connectionless protocol. A complete data
                  conversation model must account for data traffic
                  using both protocols. In this study, we measure the
                  behavior of both local and wide area networks and
                  estimate the behavior of a virtual circuit network
                  carrying the same data traffic."

  ABSTRACT =	 "This paper proposes an architecture for
                  accomplishing transport protocol processing at Gbps
                  rates. The limitations of currently used transport
                  protocols have been analyzed extensively in recent
                  literature. Several benchmark studies have
                  established the achievable throughput of ISO TP4 and
                  TCP to be in the low Mbps range; several new
                  protocols and implementation techniques have been
                  proposed to achieve 100 Mbps and higher throughput
                  rates. We briefly review some of these protocols and
                  establish the need for a radically different
                  approach to meet our objective. An estimate of the
                  aggregate processing power required for Gbps
                  throughput is developed. It is proposed that a cost
                  effective and practical solution to the processing
                  requirements could be based on a multi-processor
                  system. The opportunities for parallel processing in
                  a typical transport protocol are examined and
                  arguments are advanced for selecting a favored
                  approach. A corresponding parallel processing
                  architecture is described. Data structures used to
                  preserve packet ordering and techniques for reducing
                  contention in a multi-processing environment are
                  discussed. An implementation methodology for
                  conventional transport protocols is outlined. Some
                  suggestions are made for improving efficiency by
                  making modifications to the protocol that do not
                  compromise functionality. The performance achievable
                  with this modified architecture is analyzed and some
                  suggestions for further work are presented."

  ABSTRACT =	 "As computer communications advance further into the
                  era of lightwave networks, more strain is placed on
                  data communication components. One component
                  receiving much recent attention is the transport
                  layer, the fourther layer of the OSI model of
                  communication protocols. There has been significant
                  debate whether current transport protocols ({\em
                  e.g.}, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or
                  International Standards Organization (ISO) TP4) can
                  adequately handle the burden placed upon them by
                  newly developing and futuristic high-speed
                  networks. Alternatives such as the development of
                  new transport protocols or new protocol
                  architectures have been proposed. Lightwave networks
                  currently being introduced ({\em e.g.}, Fiber
                  Distributed Data Interface -- FDDI) supply much
                  higher bandwidth to users than current
                  networks. Future networks are expected to be able to
                  supply users with gigabit capacity, which is several
                  orders of magnitude above what current networks
                  offer. The ability of current transport protocols to
                  support these data rates has been questioned. In
                  addition, lightwave networks will supply much more
                  reliable service, with bit error rates as low as
                  $10^{-9}$ compared to networks today with bit error
                  rates of $10^{-4}$. How transport protocols may take
                  advantage of this improvement has also been
                  examined."

  ABSTRACT =	 "This paper presents a detailed architecture for the
                  parallel implementation of a feature-rich transport
                  protocol. While the architecture presented is
                  designed for a specific protocol, its use is not
                  restricted to a single protocol, or protocol
                  layer. The design is formulated by dividing general
                  protocol functions, such as connection management or
                  reliable data delivery, into subtasks which can be
                  performed in parallel. Some of these tasks are
                  performed by a dedicated process, and others are
                  distributed over several processes. The target
                  transport protocol supports several modes of
                  operation, including various acknowledgement,
                  reject, and retransmission schemes, making it
                  extremely flexible. The protocol user may instruct
                  the protocol to dynamically change modes
                  ``on-the-fly'' without loss of data. In addition,
                  other protocols may be implemented using this
                  architecture by programming their protocol rules
                  into the architecture. Protocol specific state
                  machines and structures are plugged into this
                  architecture to define packet validity, packet
                  formats, etc. This architecture supports 3-way
                  handshake or implicit connection establishment
                  procedures, 2-way handshake connection termination
                  procedures, and reliable or unreliable data
                  transmission and reception. The operation of this
                  architecture has been validated and verified using
                  the Coordination-Specification Analyzer
                  (COSPAN). This validation and verification proves
                  that the architecture opens and closes connections
                  properly, and provides reliable data transmission
                  and reception. No deadlocks are present within this
                  architecture. Analysis of a possible TCP
                  implementation using this architecture demonstrates
                  that the architecture developed here is efficient in
                  that the protocol processing is divided equitably
                  among the parallel protocol machines. Performance
                  analysis shows that the parallel architecture may
                  supply up to 60 percent higher throughput than a
                  serial implementation of TCP."

  ABSTRACT =	 "A computer network consists of a hierarchy of
                  protocols, each offering a service to the protocol
                  above using the service offered by the protocol
                  below. We present a method for 1) specifying
                  services, 2) specifying protocols, and 3)
                  constructing protocol specifications by stepwise
                  refinement of service specifications. Our method is
                  based on assertional reasoning and a refinement
                  relation between state transition systems. The
                  method is demonstrated on the transport layer, which
                  is used by application protocols such as electronic
                  mail, file transfer, remote login, etc. We construct
                  a succession of specifications, starting from a very
                  abstract transport service and culminating in
                  specific transport protocols comparable to TCP and
                  IO TP4. Each specification offers both connection
                  management and connection-specific data transfer. We
                  show how any connection-independent data transfer
                  protocol can be transformed to offer
                  connection-specific data transfer service."

  ABSTRACT =	 "We examine the issues of referencing and binding to
                  objects in large-scale distributed systems. Flexible
                  binding mechanisms are necessary to support
                  large-scale, long-running systems and
                  applications. To assist object-oriented programs
                  there is a need for cheap, fine-grain references,
                  supporting objects of arbitrary type and distributed
                  garbage collection. Support for large-scale systems
                  includes referencing fragmented objects (groups),
                  and federation of heterogeneous addressing
                  mechanisms. Our object model separates logical
                  objects from their representation atoms; binding a
                  reference connects its source to an actual target
                  atom; invocation calls a procedure of the bound
                  atom. The primitive reference operations are
                  duplication, binding, unbinding, redirecting, and
                  invoking target. Binding may cause type-checking,
                  instantiation of an atom and linking of the atom's
                  class. To support programmer-defined policies, the
                  target object may redirect the reference to any of
                  its atoms, particularly at bind time. We specify a
                  general (but simple) binding protocol that supports
                  the above mechanisms; actual implementations can be
                  derived from it, trading off completeness for
                  performance."

                  construction. Our implementation differs in that its
                  design was subject to several a priori constraints,
                  both technical and strategic. First, we did not make
                  any modifications to the UNIX kernel. Second, we
                  hoped to be able to port existing applications to
                  use the RPC. Third, we wanted to use and support a
                  particular language suite. Nonetheless, we conclude
                  that it is feasible to build an RPC system in a UNIX
                  environment, and have successfully converted
                  existing applications to use the RPC system. This
                  paper describes how the UNIX language suite,
                  networking, and process structure influenced the
                  design and constrain the applicability of remote
                  procedure calls."

  ABSTRACT =	 "A communication model is described that can serve as
                  a basis for a highly efficient communication
                  subsystem for local networks. The model contains a
                  taxonomy of communication instructions that can be
                  implemented efficiently and can be a good basis for
                  interprocessor communication. These communication
                  instructions, called remote references, cause an
                  operation to be performed by a remote process and,
                  optionally, cause a value to be returned. This paper
                  also presents implementation considerations for a
                  communication system based upon the model and
                  describes an experimental communication subsystem
                  that provides one class of remote references. These
                  remote references take about 150 microseconds or 50
                  average instruction times to perform on Xerox Alto
                  computers connected by a 2.94 megabit Ethernet."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Nectar is a multicomputer built around a
                  high-bandwidth crosspoint network. Nodes are
                  connected to Nectar using network coprocessors
                  (CABs) that do the protocol processing. The
                  communication coprocessor is based on a
                  general-purpose processor and runs a flexible
                  runtime system. This allows us to offload
                  applications on the coprocessor and to experiement
                  with different protocol implementations. An
                  important network parameter for applications is the
                  latency for short messages. In this paper, we
                  present an analysis of the CAB-CAB and host-host
                  communication latency over Nectar for a number of
                  communication protocols. We break up the latency and
                  discuss how the components are influenced by the
                  protocol implementation and node architecture."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Transport systems as they are known today will not
                  be suited for the environment of high speed networks
                  and future applications as {\em e.g.}, multi-media
                  applications. First of all, concepts to overcome the
                  protocol processing bottleneck are necessary. They
                  lead to a design of a transport oriented component
                  within a network as a conglomeration of protocol
                  functions without internal layering. This results in
                  an impressive reduction of functions to be
                  realized. Moreover, the transport service interface
                  must be designed in a way that allows an easy and
                  efficient support of various service
                  requirements. Therefore, the transport service
                  interface can be classified into four transport
                  service classes, which are derived from the
                  application requirements on performance and
                  functional criteria. Each service class is
                  associated with an individual protocol stack. The
                  paper discusses these topics with special regards to
                  flexible high speed transport systems. The
                  flexibility, which is the possibility to adapt the
                  transport system to the specific application
                  dynamically, will be obtained by using an underlying
                  multi-processor architecture, where the processing
                  of different functions in parallel will be
                  supported."

  ABSTRACT =	 "The problem of processing packets in a communication
                  node occurred due to the introduction of fiber
                  optics as transmission medium, because the data
                  rates increased drastically but the processing power
                  did not increase in the same order of magnitude. For
                  that reason, it is important to defuse the
                  processing bottleneck of communication controllers
                  and transport systems in general. Different
                  approaches have been pursued in the research of high
                  speed communications. This paper presents the
                  architecture of an efficient transport system
                  supported by a developed concept called Protocol
                  Configuration Manager (PROCOM). This mechanism
                  allows the dynamical adaptation of the running
                  protocol stack on explicitly requested application
                  requirements."

                  necessary to implement the OSI standards on a large
                  variety of real systems. Implementation of complete
                  OSI systems comprising the specified multiple layers
                  of complex protocols is a challenging task. Above
                  all, the implementation must be correct: it must
                  conform to the published specifications and interact
                  correctly with its local environment. Second, the
                  implementation should be efficient: the
                  communication subsystem should provide low delays
                  and high throughput. Furthermore, the implementers
                  should provide low delays and high
                  throughput. Furthermore, the implementers must
                  consider how general the implementation ought to be:
                  should it be optimized for a particular usage?
                  Should it be usable in different hardware/software
                  environments? In the framework of these objectives,
                  this paper examines the specification, design, and
                  implementation issues and approaches at two levels:
                  1) the realization of individual protocols, and 2)
                  the construction of complete multilayer

                  has been adopted to meet new applications prior to
                  public networks. We believe a combination of ATM
                  technology and wideband leased lines can offer
                  advanced and sophisticated features, such as high
                  speed inter-LAN connections and multimedia
                  communications for business applications in the near

  ABSTRACT =	 "Traditionally, computer communication networks have
                  been optimized with respect to throughput,
                  robustness, and absolute delay, with little or no
                  concern for the variation in delay (jitter) induced
                  by the network. It is now desirable that high speed
                  networks support a greater range of
                  telecommunication services by providing a
                  multi-service environment. If the transmission of
                  jitter-sensitive traffic is not to be arbitrarily
                  precluded, then new protocol architectures must take
                  account of, and provide support for, the constraint
                  of jitter. The ATM approach to broadband networking
                  is presently being pursued within the CCITT (and
                  elsewhere) as the unifying mechanism for the support
                  of service integration, rate adaptation, and jitter
                  control within the lower layers of the network
                  architecture. This position paper is specifically
                  concerned with the jitter arising from the design of
                  the middle and upper layers that operate within the
                  end systems and relays of multi-service networks

  ABSTRACT =	 "The continued expansion of computer networks and the
                  miniaturization of computers increase the desire to
                  use one's computer in a consistent computational
                  environment, regardless of location and time. In
                  this situation, host migration transparency is very
                  important. This paper introduces a new network
                  architecture which provides host migration
                  transparency in large interconnected networks and
                  proposes a protocol based on the propagating cache
                  method. We introduce the concept of virtual network
                  and divide the conventional network layer into two
                  sublayers to realize host migration
                  transparency. Virtual Internet Protocol, or VIP for
                  short, is derived from DARPA-IP as an example of the
                  architecture. We estimate the overhead of VIP. Host
                  migration transparency can be realized without
                  significant processing and traffic overhead. This
                  architecture also preserves host migration
                  transparency across virtual circuits in radio
                  networks."

                  and a cache. The caches are coherent, so that all
                  processors see a consistent view of main memory. The
                  firefly runs a software system that emulates the
                  Ultrix system call interface, and in addition
                  provides support for multiprocessing through
                  multiple threads of control in a single address
                  space. Communication is provided uniformly through
                  the use of remote procedure call. We describe the
                  goals, hardware, software system, and performance of
                  the Firefly, and discuss the extent to which SRC has

  ABSTRACT =	 "We have implemented the Xerox Networking Systems
                  protocol suite in 4.2 BSD UNIX in order to
                  communicate with Xerox workstations which do not
                  implement TCP/IP. In this paper, we discuss the
                  problems we encountered while making the necessary
                  changes to the UNIX kernel. We found a multitude of
                  TCP/IP dependencies in the lowest level UNIX device
                  driver and network interface code, which were
                  eliminated by replacing inline code with protocol
                  specific subroutine calls. Another problem was that
                  4.2BSD expects all protocols to be connectionless or
                  byte stream, and the XNS stream level is neither. We
                  generalize the socket code to satisfy the additional
                  requirements of the XNS stream protocol. The result
                  of all these changes is not just the ability to
                  handle XNS but a more general network system within
                  TCP/IP dependencies, ready for the next generation
                  of protocols."

                  which they must be arranged, exclude a large class
                  of potential communication protocols. We propose to
                  investigate more flexible protocol stacks consisting
                  of a protocol environment populated by standard
                  communication functionalities. The main ingredient
                  is the ability for an application to compose
                  protocol stacks out of standard protocol entities as
                  well as the downline loading of new protocol
                  entities. This leads to application-tailored,
                  extensible stacks, possibly established at run-time
                  by a bootstrap procedure. Different ways to
                  implement such an environment are discussed, and the
                  current work on a toy environment is presented."

  ABSTRACT =	 "Conventional algorithms to implement an Operating
                  System timer module take $O(n)$ time to start or
                  maintain a timer, where $n$ is the number of
                  outstanding timers: this is expensive for large
                  $n$. This paper begins by exploring the relationship
                  between timer algorithms, time flow mechanisms used
                  in discrete event simulations, and sorting
                  techniques. Next a timer algorithm for small timer
                  intervales is presented that is similar to the
                  timing wheel technique used in logic simulators. By
                  using a circular buffer or timing wheel, it takes
                  $O(1)$ time to start, stop, and maintain timers
                  within the range of the wheel. Two extensions for
                  larger values of the interval are described. In the
                  first, the timer interval is hashed into a slot on
                  the timing wheel. In the second, a hierarchy of
                  timing wheels with different granularities is used
                  to span a greater range of intervals. The
                  performance of these two schemes and various
                  implementation tradeoffs are discussed."

                  find the semiautomatic approach to protocol
                  implementation offers several advantages over the
                  conventional manual one, including correctness and
                  modularity in protocol implementation code,
                  conformance to the specification, and reduction in

                  designed to meet such goals. Delta-t's main
                  contribution is in the area of connection

                  management without explicit packet exchanges. This

                  access system services through the Sprite kernel on
                  their local host, and the local kernel makes remote
                  procedure calls to access services located on remote
                  hosts. Each kernel has several RPC channels so that
                  it can be making RPCs for several processes
                  concurrently. A server machine keeps several kernel
                  server processes that are used to execute service
                  procedures. Messages carry requests for remote
                  procedure execute to server kernels and carry
                  results back to client kernels. The RPC network
                  protocol requires only two messages per RPC in the
                  common case. The protocol also supports efficient
                  data transfers larger than the network packet size
                  to meet the bandwidth requirements of Sprite's

                  of the implementation factors which affects the
                  execution workload of a protocol implementation: if
                  possible, copying the user data should be
                  avoided. Two `buffer cut-through' strategies for
                  avoiding copying higher level data are described,
                  with some of the mechanisms necessary to implement

                  to be as high as 80 percent when the checksum is not

                  protocol processing and network interfacing. The
                  design for XTP arises from the needs of contemporary
                  and future distributed and Real-time
                  systems. Existing protocol systems, e.g., TCP and
                  ISO TP4, do not meet all of the perceived
                  requirements. The major issue is that they provide
                  ``traditional'' end-to-end and router functions,
                  whereas distributed systems have additional
                  needs. Distributed systems depend on remote
                  procedure calls and rapid request/response
                  operations, leading to requirements for reliable
                  datagram mechanisms. They may also require multicast
                  capabilities. Real-time systems need to control
                  latencies and delays, leading to requirements for
                  scheduling events within protocol layers. XTP meets
                  these and other needs by providing:"

                  stands out as the bottleneck in process migration,
                  dominating all other costs and growing with the size
                  of the program. Copy-on-reference shipment is shown
                  to successfully attack this problem in the Accent
                  distributed computing environment. Logical memory
                  transfers at migration time with individual
                  on-demand page fetches during remote execution
                  allows relocations to occur up to one thousand times
                  faster than with standard techniques. While the
                  amount of allocated memory varies by four orders of
                  magnitude across the processes studied, their
                  transfer times are practically constant. The number
                  of bytes exchanged between machines as a result of
                  migration and remote execution drops by an average
                  of 58% in the representative processes studied, and
                  message-handling costs are cut by over 47% on
                  average. The assumption that process touch a
                  relatively small part of their memory while
                  executing is shown to be correct, helping to account
                  for these figures. Accent's copy-on-reference
                  facility can be used by any application wishing to
                  take advantage of lazy shipment of data."

                  upcalls. It enables data passing through layers
                  without copying, relying on the principle of passing
                  responsibility for the buffer from one layer to
                  another. Data is shared among several layers. These
                  buffers are divided into a header buffer and a data
                  buffer. When packet is received, the transport
                  protocol needs to create the transport header. No
                  data copying or data buffer handling is
                  required. Implementation of the BCT in TCP/IP is

                  protocols. Multi-processor architectures will be
                  well suited to increase the performance of those

                  for the implementation of the OSI communication
                  protocols realizing transport systems is
                  presented. The design is based on a horizontal and
                  vertical subdivision of communication systems. The
                  parallel architecture consists of several building
                  blocks, (e.g., pipeline, array of processors) and
                  supports multiple memory concepts (local and global

                  layer, so called layer machines (send and receive
                  part of a layer) can operate in parallel within the
                  same layer and the computing of different layers can
                  be overlapped. First prototype implementations of
                  the OSI Transport Protocol class 4 and the OSI

                  applications to request the communication service
                  that they need. Based on service requirements and on
                  available resources, a suiteable protocol machine is
                  configured to serve the applications. This
                  configuration is done using a proper combination of
                  protocol functions. The conept of layering is

                  the same loss rate. However, the throughput of fully

                  of the Choices operating system project. The use of
                  C++ makes bit and byte-level manipulations easy, at
                  the same time allowing the programmer to exploit
                  object-oriented features such as type-checking,
                  inheritance and polymorphism. The structure imposed
                  on the system by the class hierarchy makes the code
                  easier to understand and permits reuse of both code

                  change protocol that is compatible with rate
                  monotonic analysis. The protocol models a task
                  parameter change as a task deletion/task addition
                  pair. The protocol shows how to handle semaphores
                  that are used for task synchronization. The analysis
                  looks like a straightforward augmentation to RMS,
                  and very useful. The paper does not discuss the
                  application-specific aspects of mode changes, such
                  as deciding the task changes and the order in which
                  they should be implemented. And the really hard
                  issues, like deciding what each task should do when
                  the ``global'' mode changes."

  ABSTRACT =	 "{Simulation and verification are the two
                  conventional techniques for the analysis of
                  specifications of Real-time systems. While
                  simulation is relatively inexpensive in terms of
                  execution time, it only validates the behavior of a
                  system for one particular computation path. On the
                  other hand, verification provides guarantees over
                  the entire set of computation paths of a system, but
                  is, in general, very expensive due to the
                  state-space explosion problem. In this paper, we
                  introduce a new technique: Simulation-verification
                  combines the best of both worlds by synthesizing an
                  intermediate analysis method. This method uses
                  simulation to limit the generation of a computation
                  graph to that set of computations consistent with
                  the simulation. This limited computation graph,
                  called a simulation-verification graph, can be one
                  or more orders of magnitude smaller than the full
                  computation graph. A tool, XSVT, is described which
                  implements simulation-verification graphs. Three
                  paradigms for using the new technique are
                  proposed. The paper illustrates the application of
                  the proposed technique via an example of a robot
                  controller for a manufacturing assembly line.}"

                  authors have developed 1) a scheduling service and
                  2) a monitoring service. The scheduling service
                  utilizes the concept of TaskPairs (TPs) to guarantee
                  timely execution of all tasks even when some have
                  execution times different than their specified
                  WCET. A TP comprises a MainTask (MT) and an
                  ExceptTask (ET). The MT wraps the application task,
                  in effect. The ET is always hard, i.e., it has a
                  well-known WCET. It handles overrun of its
                  corresponding MT. The scheduler ensures that the ET
                  can always run, thereby providing tolerance for TP
                  timing faults. They how this approach can be
                  integrated into CORBA."

  Review =	 "Introduces the technique of {\em parametric
                  dispatching} to enforce relative timing
                  constraints. It is intended for use in statically
                  scheduled, non-preemptive systems. The relative
                  timing constraints must provide a total ordering on
                  the tasks. In contrast to other approaches, however,
                  worst case execution times need not be
                  provided. Instead, upper and lower bounds on
                  execution times are used. Both on-line and off-line
                  components are included in parametric
                  dispatching. The off-line component analyzes the
                  timing constraints and generates a calendar of
                  functions which yield the upper and lower bounds of
                  each task. The on-line scheduling component
                  evaluates these functions and provides the bounds to
                  the dispatcher."

  ABSTRACT =	 "The rapid increase in performance of mass market
                  commodity microprocessors and significant disparity
                  in pricing between PCs and scientific workstations
                  has provided an opportunity for substantial gains in
                  performance to cost by harnessing PC technology in
                  parallel ensembles to provide high end capability
                  for scientific and engineering applications. The
                  Beowulf project is a NASA initiative sponsored by
                  the HPCC program to explore the potential of
                  Pile-of-PCs and to develop the necessary
                  methodologies to apply these low cost system
                  configurations to NASA computational requirements in
                  the Earth and space sciences. Recently, a 16
                  processor Beowulf costing less than \$50,000
                  sustained 1.25 Gigaflops on a gravitational N-body
                  simulation of 10 million particles with a Tree code
                  algorithm using standard commodity hardware and
                  software components. This paper describes the
                  technologies and methodologies employed to achieve
                  this breakthrough. Both opportunities afforded by
                  this approach and the challenges confronting its
                  application to real-world problems are discussed in
                  the framework of hardware and software systems as
                  well as the results from benchmarking
                  experiments. Finally, near term technology trends
                  and future directions of the Pile-of-PCs concept are
                  considered. "

                  today, and the emergence of mobile code technologies
                  that make dynamic network service innovation
                  attainable. In this article, the authors discuss two

  ABSTRACT =	 "Flexible, reconfigurable vision systems can provide
                  an extremely rich sensing modality for sophisticated
                  multiple robot platforms. We propose a cooperative
                  and adaptive approach of panoramic vision to the
                  problem of finding and protecting humans by a robot
                  team in an emergency circumstance (e.g. a rescue in
                  an office building). A panoramic virtual stereo
                  vision method is proposed for this cooperative
                  approach, which features omni-directional visual
                  sensors, cooperative mobile platforms, selected 3D
                  matching, and Real-time moving object (people)
                  detection and tracking. The problems of dynamic
                  self-calibration and robust 3D estimation of moving
                  objects are discussed. A careful error analysis of
                  the panoramic stereo triangulation is presented in
                  order to derive rules for optimal view
                  planning. Experimental results are given for
                  detecting and localizing multiple moving objects
                  using two cooperative robot platforms. Keywords:
                  omnidirectional vision, multiple mobile robots,
                  moving object extraction, cooperative stereo"

  ABSTRACT =	 {Region-based memory management systems structure
                  memory by grouping objects in regions under program
                  control. Memory is reclaimed by deleting regions,
                  freeing all objects stored therein. Our compiler for
                  C with regions, RC, prevents unsafe region deletions
                  by keeping a count of references to each
                  region. Using type annotations that make the
                  structure of a program's regions more explicit, we
                  reduce the overhead of reference counting from a
                  maximum of 27\% to a maximum of 11\% on a suite of
                  realistic benchmarks. We generalise these
                  annotations in a region type system whose main
                  novelty is the use of existentially quantified
                  abstract regions to represent pointers to objects
                  whose region is partially or totally unknown. A
                  distribution of RC is available at
                  \url{www.cs.berkeley.edu/~dgay/rc.tar.gz}.}

  ABSTRACT =	 {The Real-time Specification for Java (RTSJ)
                  introduces the concept of nested-scope memory areas
                  to Java. This design allows a programmer to allocate
                  objects in areas that are ignored by the garbage
                  collector. Unfortunately, the specification of
                  scoped memory areas currently involves the
                  introduction of unwieldy, application-specific
                  constructs that can ruin the reusability of the
                  affected software. We propose the use of aspects, in
                  particular the AspectJ system, to transform a Java
                  program into a scope-aware RTSJ program
                  automatically. Moreover, we have developed analysis
                  that automatically determines storage scopes, in
                  response to information provided by an instrumented
                  form of the application at hand. That
                  instrumentation is also accomplished using
                  aspects. Here we present our ongoing work in using
                  aspects to detect and specify memory scopes
                  automatically in Java programs.},

  ABSTRACT =	 {Compilers and other program-analysis tools often
                  rely on profiling information obtained from the
                  programs they analyze. Obtaining such information
                  can be a tedious task. The most detailed information
                  is often obtained by arranging for code generators
                  to instrument the code they generate or by
                  collecting such information through instrumented
                  interpretation. Access to code generators and
                  interpreters is often beyond the capability of
                  ordinary users. In this paper, we examine the
                  advantages of using aspects for this purpose and
                  present code that harvests runtime information for
                  subsequent offline analysis.},

  abstract =	 {The components of a loosely-coupled system are
                  typically designed to operate by generating and
                  responding to asynchronous events. An \emph{event
                  notification service} is an application-independent
                  infrastructure that supports the construction of
                  event-based systems, whereby generators of events
                  publish event notifications to the infrastructure
                  and consumers of events subscribe with the
                  infrastructure to receive relevant
                  notifications. The two primary services that should
                  be provided to components by the infrastructure are
                  notification selection (i.e., determining which
                  notifications match which subscriptions) and
                  notification delivery (i.e, routing matching
                  notifications from publishers to
                  subscribers). Numerous event notification services
                  have been developed for local-area networks,
                  generally based on a centralized server to select
                  and deliver event notifications. Therefore, they
                  suffer from an inherent inability to scale to
                  wide-area networks, such as the Internet, where the
                  number and physical distribution of the service's
                  clients can quickly overwhelm a centralized
                  solution. The critical challenge in the setting of a
                  wide-area network is to maximize the expressiveness
                  in the selection mechanism without sacrificing
                  scalability in the delivery mechanism. This paper
                  presents \emph{Siena}, an event notification service
                  that we have designed and implemented to exhibit
                  both expressiveness and scalability. We describe the
                  service's interface to applications, the algorithms
                  used by networks of servers to select and deliver
                  event notifications, and the strategies used to
                  optimize performance. We also present results of
                  simulation studies that examine the scalability and
                  performance of the service.}

                  for distributed event-based applications deployed
                  over wide-area networks. Siena is responsible for
                  selecting the notifications that are of interest to
                  clients (as expressed in client subscriptions) and
                  then delivering those notifications to the clients
                  via access points. The key design challenge for
                  Siena is maximizing expressiveness in the selection
                  mechanism without sacrificing scalability of the
                  delivery mechanism. This paper focuses on those
                  aspects of the design of Siena that fundamentally
                  impact scalability and expressiveness. In
                  particular, we describe Siena's data model for
                  notifications, the covering relations that formally
                  define the semantics of the data model, the
                  distributed architectures we have studied for
                  Siena's implementation, and the processing
