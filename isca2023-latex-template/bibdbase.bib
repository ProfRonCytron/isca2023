                 information---either may-alias or must-alias---in

                 and recursive data structures: more precisely, he
                 showed that the may-alias relation is not recursive,
                 while the must-alias relation is not even recursively
                 enumerable. This article presents simpler proofs of the

  abstract =     "Considering the renewed interest in stack machines
                  (in particular, the Java Virtual Machine), efficient
                  execution of Algol-family languages on this class of
                  hardware becomes increasingly important. Local
                  variable accesses in the source language should be
                  translated into stack accesses on the target machine
                  (in analogy to register allocation on register
                  machines).\par In this paper we explore such stack
                  allocation techniques for basic blocks. We present
                  some improvements to Phil Koopman's \emph{stack
                  scheduling}, add an instruction scheduler and
                  compare the result with an optimal stack allocation
                  and instruction scheduling strategy. Stack
                  scheduling in cooperation with depth first postorder
                  instruction scheduling produces results close to the
                  optimum. The optimizations discussed in this paper
                  are profitable only for stack hardware where stack
                  manipulation operations are faster than local
                  variable accesses."}

abstract = {This paper presents a cache coherence solution for multiprocessors organized around a single time-shared bus. The solution aims at reducing bus traffic and hence bus wait time. This in turn increases the overall processor utilization. Unlike most traditional high-performance coherence solutions, this solution does not use any global tables. Furthermore, this coherence scheme is modular and easily extensible, requiring no modification of cache modules to add more processors to a system. The performance of this scheme is evaluated by using an approximate analysis method. It is shown that the performance of this scheme is closely tied with the miss ratio and the amount of sharing between processors.},

By embedding Chisel in the Scala programming language, we raise the level of hardware design abstraction by providing concepts including object orientation, functional programming, parameterized types, and type inference. Chisel can generate a high-speed C++-based cycle-accurate software simulator, or low-level Verilog designed to map to either FPGAs or to a standard ASIC flow for synthesis. This paper presents Chisel, its embedding in Scala, hardware examples, and results for C++ simulation, Verilog emulation and ASIC synthesis.},

abstract = {Feature-oriented programming (FOP) is a programming technique to implement software product lines based on composition mechanisms called refinements. A software product line is a set of software systems that share a common, managed set of features satisfying the specific needs of a particular market segment. The literature reports various software metrics for software product lines developed using object-oriented and aspect-oriented programming. However, after a literature review, we observed that we lack the definition of FOP-specific metrics. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a set of eight novel metrics for feature-oriented programming. These metrics were derived both from our experience in FOP and from existing software metrics. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed metrics by applying them to a software product line.},

abstract = {Timed automata are state-machine-like structures used to model real-time systems. Since their invention in the early 1990s, a number of often subtly differing variants have appeared in the literature; one of this article’s key contributions is defining, highlighting, and reconciling these differences. The article achieves this by defining a baseline theory of timed automata, characterizing each variant both syntactically and semantically, and giving, when possible, syntactic and semantic conversion to and from the baseline version. This article also surveys various extensions to the basic timed-automaton framework.},

Our purpose is to introduce the what and the how of the GP approach from a programming language point of view. For the what we discuss the lessons learned from object-oriented languages seen as general purpose languages to develop software factories. For the how we compare a variety of approaches and techniques based on program transformation and generation. On the one hand, we present the evolution of open-ended languages from metalevel programming to aspect-oriented programming. On the other hand, we introduce domain-specific languages as a way to bridge the gap between conceptual models and programming languages.",

    Abstract = {BOOM is a synthesizable, parameterized, superscalar out-of-order RISC-V core designed to serve as the prototypical baseline processor for future micro-architectural studies of out-of-order processors. Our goal is to provide a readable, open-source implementation for use in education, research, and industry.

BOOM is written in roughly 9,000 lines of the hardware construction language Chisel. We leveraged Berkeley’s open-source Rocket-chip SoC generator, allowing us to quickly bring up an entire multi-core processor system (including caches and uncore) by replacing the in-order Rocket core with an out-of-order BOOM core. BOOM supports atomics, IEEE 754-2008 floating-point, and page-based virtual memory. We have demonstrated BOOM running Linux, SPEC CINT2006, and CoreMark.}
